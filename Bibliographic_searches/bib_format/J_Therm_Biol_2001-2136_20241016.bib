Abstract = {Environmental temperature is a crucial resource for ectotherms,
   affecting their physiology, behaviour and fitness. To maintain body
   temperatures within a suitable performance range, ectotherms select
   thermallyfavourable locations, but this selection may be challenging in
   environments with high spatio-temporal heterogeneity. We assessed
   thermal habitat selection in two freshwater turtles (Emydoidea
   blandingii; Chrysemys picta) within a thermally heterogeneous
   environment at two spatial scales (selection of home ranges within the
   landscape, selection of locations within home ranges) and across
   seasons, by comparing temperatures at turtle locations vs. those
   available in the environment. Turtles selected warmer locations compared
   to those available in aquatic and terrestrial habitats only within home
   ranges, but did not show any temperature preferences when selecting home
   ranges at the larger scale. Turtles selected locations that were less
   thermally-variable than their surroundings, both at the home range scale
   and within home ranges. Thermal habitat selection was strongest during
   colder and more thermally-variable pre-nesting season compared to later
   periods. Despite differences in thermal mass between species, both
   species responded similarly to temperature variation. We conclude that
   freshwater turtles at their northern range margin select suitable
   microclimates within the suite of conditions that are naturally
   available.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to determine the optimal temperature for
   Juvenile Coreius guichenoti, which is critically endangered in China.
   Test fish with an initial body weight range of 17.60-18.78 g were reared
   in 5 independent recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) with three
   tanks (50 fish/tank) for 8 weeks. The water temperature of the RAS was
   set at 14 \& DEG;C, 18 \& DEG;C, 22 \& DEG;C, 26 \& DEG;C, and 30 \&
   DEG;C, respectively. At conclusion of the feeding trial, the effects of
   water temperature on C. guichenoti were analyzed based on survival,
   growth performance, digestive enzymes activities, and antioxidant
   capacity. The results showed that the fish survived in all temperature
   groups. The fish in the groups (26 \& DEG;C and 30 \& DEG;C) had higher
   values of body length, body weight, specific growth rate, weight gain
   rate, and daily gain than those in the group (22 \& DEG;C). The lowest
   values of growth performance were observed in the groups (14 \& DEG;C
   and 18 \& DEG;C) among the 5 groups. The lowest values of feed
   conversion ratio (FCR) were observed in the group (26 \& DEG;C).
   Regression analysis identified the minimum FCR at 26.55 \& DEG;C. The
   feeding rates (FR) were increased gradually with the increase of
   temperature. Regression analysis identified the maximum FR at 28.33 \&
   DEG;C. The activities of protease and lipase in the gut were higher than
   those in the liver, while amylase activity was lower in the gut than
   that in the liver. There were no significant differences in ac-tivities
   of protease and lipase among different parts of the intestinal tract at
   the temperatures range from 18 to 26 \& DEG;C. When the temperature was
   out the optimal range, C. guichenoti would be under chronic stress,
   resulting in decreased lysozyme activity and cortisol concentration.
   Inconclusion, the optimal temperature for juvenile C. guichenoti is
   26.55-28.33 \& DEG;C based on the maximal growth performance and feed
   utilization.},

Title = {Constant-temperature predictions underestimate growth of a fungal
   amphibian pathogen under individual host thermal profiles},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {111},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Ectotherm body temperatures fluctuate with environmental variability and
   host behavior, which may influence host-pathogen interactions. Fungal
   pathogens are a major threat to ectotherms and may be highly responsive
   to the fluctuating thermal profiles of individual hosts, especially
   cool-loving fungi exposed to high host temperatures. However, most
   studies estimate pathogen thermal performance based on averages of host
   or surrogate environmental temperatures, potentially missing effects of
   short-term host temperature shifts such as daily or hourly heat spikes.
   We recorded individual thermal profiles of Australian rainforest frogs
   using temperaturesensitive radio-transmitters. We then reproduced a
   subset of individual thermal profiles in growth chambers containing
   cultures of the near-global amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium
   dendrobatidis (Bd) to investigate how realistic host temperature
   profiles affect Bd growth. We focused on thermal profiles that exceed
   the thermal optimum of Bd because the effects of realistic heat spikes
   on Bd growth are unresolved. Our laboratory incubation experiment
   revealed that Bd growth varied in response to relatively small
   differences in heat spike characteristics of individual frog thermal
   profiles, such as a single degree or a few hours, highlighting the
   importance of individual host behaviors in predicting population-level
   disease dynamics. The fungus also grew better than predicted under the
   most extreme and unpredictable frog temperature profile, recovering from
   two days of extreme (nearly 32 degrees C) heat spikes without negative
   effects on overall growth, suggesting we are underestimating the growth
   potential of the pathogen in nature. Combined with the previous finding
   that Bd reduces host heat tolerance, our study suggests that this
   pathogen may carry a competitive edge over hosts in the face of
   anthropogenic climate change.},

Title = {Reproducibility of skin temperature analyses by novice and experienced
   evaluators using infrared thermography},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {110},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Infrared thermography (IRT) has become popular in several areas of
   knowledge. However, the analyses of thermal images often request manual
   actions, and little is known about the effect of the evaluator's
   experience on analysis thermal images. Here, we determine the
   reproducibility of IRT images analysis performed by evaluators with
   different levels of experience. Eight evaluators (GE, group experienced,
   n = 4; GN, group novice, n = 4) analyzed thermograms from 40 healthy
   participants recorded before and after exercise to determine the mean,
   minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and range of skin temperature in
   the anterior thigh and posterior leg. Before and after exercise, mean
   temperature showed excellent reproducibility for both groups for the
   anterior thigh (ICC >0.98) and posterior leg (ICC >0.94), and maximum
   temperature showed excellent reproducibility for both groups in the
   posterior leg (ICC >0.91). The influence of experience level was not
   significant considering the anterior thigh. Similarly, experience level
   did not affect the mean, maximum, and standard deviation tem-perature
   determined for the posterior leg. For the posterior leg, minimum
   temperature presented lower values and the range was higher among novice
   evaluators. Mean skin temperature showed narrower 95\% limits of
   agreement than minimum and maximum for both regions and moments. Caution
   is advised when temperature ranges and minimums are determined by
   different evaluators. We conclude that for IRT analysis by evaluators
   with different levels of experience, the mean and maximum temperatures
   should be prioritized due to their better reproducibility.},

Title = {A study of physical factors influencing park cooling intensities and
   their effects in different time of the day},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {109},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The quality of residents' lives have been negatively affected by
   problems resulting from global warming and urban heat island.
   Investigators have explored several ways to mitigate those problems.
   They found that vege-tation (especially trees) and water surfaces played
   a significant role in the adjustments of climate. Sites with more
   vegetation and larger-size waterbodies were cooler. However, the cooling
   effects of these elements were affected by contextual factors. For
   instance, cooling intensities of both vegetation and water surfaces
   fluctuated through the day. To further explore this phenomenon, this
   study investigated the cooling effects of trees and large waterbodies at
   different times of the day by means of field measurement. It was found
   that leaf area index (LAI) and distance from the sea (DFS) had a
   significant impact on park cooling intensities (PCI). Park points with
   more trees (indicated higher LAI) and those located closer to the sea
   were cooler. In addition, their cooling effects varied depending on the
   time of the day. LAI showed significant microclimatic adjusting effects
   late in the evening. Increasing the LAI by 1 point could help increase
   the PCI by 0.31 degrees C (18:00, R2 = 0.2421). In contrast, rising DFS
   resulted in PCI decrease by more than 2 degrees C (12:00 p.m., R2 =
   0.4327). Cooling performances of the two factors were significant at
   different time periods of the day, that is, in the noon (the sea) and
   evening (trees) respectively. Further, the cooling effects of the trees
   might be affected by the distance from the sea. Findings from this study
   provided new understandings towards the climatic conditions of waterside
   cities.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {108},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The study was aimed at evaluating the concentration of serum thyroid
   hormones and diurnal trends in rectal and body surface temperatures in
   neonatal buck-kids and doelings. Rectal and body surface (eye, head and
   trunk) temperatures as well as the differences between rectal and
   surface (DBRS) temperatures were determined in 39 kids, having equal
   number of Red Sokoto, Sahel and West African Dwarf (WAD) goats during
   daytime nadir (07:00 h) and zenith (13:00 h) in ambient temperatures.
   All variables and blood samples were obtained from birth to Day 20,
   post-natal. Results revealed significantly (P < 0.05) lower values of
   morning and afternoon rectal temperatures at birth with subsequent
   post-natal increase, attaining higher stable values after Day 2. Morning
   head surface temperature decreased significantly after birth, whereas,
   DBRS temperatures were lower at birth and increased in subsequent days.
   From birth, diurnality was distinct (P < 0.05) in all body surface and
   DBRS temperatures, while, diurnality in rectal temperature was only
   observed on Days 1-8 (P < 0.05). All body temperatures (rectal, eye,
   head and trunk) recorded during the afternoon hours in the late neonatal
   life (Days 10-20) were significantly higher in WAD than Red Sokoto and
   Sahel kids. Buck-kids had higher (P < 0.05) values of morning rectal
   temperature than doelings. Circulating concentration of
   tri-iodothyronine was significantly lower in Sahel than Red Sokoto and
   WAD goat kids, whereas, the values of thyroxin were lower (P < 0.05) in
   Red Sokoto than Sahel and WAD kids. Similarly, lower (P < 0.05) values
   of tri-iodothyronine were recorded in buck -kids, while a higher (P <
   0.05) level of thyroxin was recorded in doelings. In conclusion,
   neonatal adjustment in body temperatures of tropical breeds was
   influenced by thyroid hormone concentration, and the feeble cutaneous
   thermoregulation atbirth, contributed significantly to heat loss and
   gain during the morning and afternoon hours, respectively.},

Title = {Temporal climatic variability predicts thermal tolerance in two
   sympatric lizard species},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {108},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Thermal acclimatization, plastic shifts in thermal physiology in
   response to recent climatic conditions, is thought to be adaptive in
   highly seasonal environments where thermal variability is high but
   predictable. Thus, lizards from mid-latitude, desert environments should
   exhibit plasticity in their thermal tolerance limits, the upper (CTmax)
   and lower (CTmin) body temperatures they can withstand while maintaining
   physiological functioning, associated with changes in seasonal changes
   in climatic variation (i.e., when daily fluctuations in temperature are
   greater, lizards should have wider thermal tolerance breadths
   {[}CTmax-CTmin]). We measured the thermal tolerance limits of two
   Phrynosomatid lizard species, Uta stansburiana and Sceloporus
   tristichus, occurring in sympatry at three time points to test for
   temporal variation in thermal physiology in response to climatic
   variation. We found that lizards of both species measured during times
   when climatic variability was high had wider thermal tolerance breadths
   than lizards measured when climatic variability was lower. While CTmax
   was largely invariable, CTmin varied in response to minimum air
   temperature, driving the observed difference in thermal tolerance
   breadth among the sampling periods.},

Abstract = {The present study aimed to investigate the effects of different physical
   forms of feed and feeding programs on nutrient digestibility and
   performance of grower-finisher broilers under thermoneutrality or
   thermal stress. Three experiments were conducted using male broiler
   chickens (n = 720) aged 19-42 d. The design of two of the experiments
   was fully randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with two forms of
   feed (mash and pellet) and two nutritional levels (13.19 MJ/kg and 194.8
   g/kg CP - normal level and 13.61 MJ/kg and 210.3 g/kg CP - high level).
   The experiments took place in a climate-controlled room: Experiment 1 at
   thermoneutrality (21-23 degrees C and 58-60\% relative humidity) for 24
   h/day; Experiment 2 under thermal stress cycle (31-32 degrees C and
   63-65\% relative humidity), for 6h/day and thermoneutrality (21-23
   degrees C, 58-60\% relative humidity) for 18h/day. The nutrient
   digestibility and performance was analyzed. The design of the third
   experiment was fully randomized with two ambient condition treatments
   (thermoneutral and thermal stress) on heat production, caloric increment
   and net energy. Pellet feed obtained higher digestibility of dry matter,
   digestibility of crude protein, AME and AMEn (P < 0.05) than mash feed
   for broilers reared in the thermoneutral environment. At the high
   nutritional level there was no effect of treatments on the coefficient
   of dry matter and crude protein (DCCP) (P > 0.05), while the highest
   digestibility of AME and AMEn were obtained by the high nutritional
   level diet (P < 0.05). Pellet feed had higher DCCP (P < 0.05) than mash
   feed for broilers reared under cyclic heat stress. Broiler chickens
   under cyclic stress experienced increased caloric increment, rectal
   temperature and respiratory rate. The appropriate strategy to minimize
   these effects in both ambient conditions is to pellet feed.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The poultry industry faces several obstacles and challenges, including
   the changes in global temperature, increase in the per capita demand for
   meat and eggs, and the emergence and spread of various diseases. Among
   these, environmental challenges are one of the most severe hurdles
   impacting the growth and productivity of poultry. In particular, the
   increasing frequency and severity of heat waves over the past few years
   represent a major challenge, and this is expected to worsen in the
   coming decades. Chickens are highly susceptible to high ambient
   temperatures (thermal stress), which negatively affect their growth and
   productivity, leading to enormous economic losses. In the light of
   global warming, these losses are expected to increase in the near
   future. Specifically, the worsening of climate change and the rise in
   global temperatures have augmented the adverse effects of heat on
   poultry production worldwide. At present, the world population is
   approximately 7.9 billion, and it has been predicted to reach 9.3
   billion by 2050 and approximately 11 billion by 2100, implying a great
   demand for protein supply; therefore, strategies to mitigate future
   poultry challenges must be urgently devised. To date, several mitigation
   measures have been adopted to minimize the negative effects of heat
   stress in poultry. Of these, thermal acclimation at the postnatal stage
   or throughout the embryonic stages has been explored as a promising
   approach; however, for large-scale application, this approach warrants
   further investigation to determine the suitable temperature and poultry
   age. Moreover, molecular mechanisms governing thermal conditioning are
   poorly understood. To this end, we sought to expand our knowledge of
   thermal conditioning in poultry, which may serve as a valuable reference
   to improve the thermotolerance of chickens via nutritional management
   and vitagene regulation. Vitagenes regulate the responses of poultry to
   diverse stresses. In recent years, nutritionists have paid close
   attention to bioactive compounds such as resveratrol, curcumin, and
   quercetin administered alone or in combination. These compounds activate
   vitagenes and other regulators of the antioxidant defense system, such
   as nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2. Overall, thermal
   conditioning may be an effective strategy to mitigate the negative
   effects of heat stress. In this context, the present review synthesizes
   information on the adverse impacts of thermal stress, elucidating the
   molecular mechanisms underlying thermal conditioning and its effects on
   the acquisition of tolerance to acute heat stress in later life.
   Finally, the role of some polyphenolic compounds, such as resveratrol,
   curcumin, and quercetin, in attenuating heat stress through the
   activation of the antioxidant defense system in poultry are discussed.},

Title = {The thermal tolerance of a tropical population of blue crab
   (<i>Callinectes sapidus</i>) modulates aerobic metabolism during hypoxia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The blue crab Callinectes sapidus is a widespread ectothermic species
   that supports large fisheries. Physiology of temperate and subtropical
   populations of blue crabs are well studied; however, a lack of
   information exists on tropical populations. Given the low locomotion
   capabilities of C. sapidus adult blue crabs, natural selection should
   favor traits that shape a particular thermal niche reflected through
   tolerance modulation to dissolved oxygen (DO). This study was designed
   to evaluate the thermal window and hypoxia sensitivity of the blue crab
   population in the southern Gulf of Mexico. The effect of acclimation
   temperatures from 20 degrees C to 34 degrees C on thermal preference
   (TP), critical thermal limits (CT), and thermal metabolic scope (TMS)
   was assessed in normoxia. Metabolic rate regulation over oxygen partial
   pressure (pO(2)) gradient was evaluated through oxygen consumption
   measurements at different degrees of acute hypoxia. Callinectes sapidus
   was observed tending to specialize towards higher temperatures, showing
   a mean TP from 26 degrees C to 33 degrees C. The lowest performance of
   aerobic pathways was observed at the coldest regimes and the highest at
   the warmest ones with mean TMS value being 35 \% greater at 34 degrees C
   than 20 degrees C. Patterns for metabolic regulation were dependent on
   the interaction between environmental temperature and DO, in which the
   interval from 29 degrees C to 34 degrees C provoked a 50 \% reduction in
   oxygen consumption when exposed to similar to 20\% air saturation
   levels. The results obtained showed that blue crabs distributed in the
   southern Gulf of Mexico could be close to their oxygen-temperature
   tolerance limits, which has important implications when climate change
   effects on species re-distribution is considered.},

Abstract = {Introduction: To determine if electrolyte or carbohydrate
   supplementation vs. water would limit the magnitude of dehydration and
   decline in cognitive function in humans following long-duration
   hyperthermic-exercise.
   Methods: 24 subjects performed 3 visits of 2 h walking (3mph/7\% grade)
   in an environmental chamber (33 degrees C/ 10\% relative humidity). In
   random order, subjects consumed water (W), electrolytes (Gatorade Zero;
   E), or electrolytes+carbohydrates (Gatorade; E+C). Throughout exercise
   (EX), subjects carried a 23 kg pack and drank ad-libitum. Pre-and
   post-EX, body mass (BM) and plasma osmolality (pOsm) were measured.
   Physiological Strain Index (PSI) and core temperature (T-C) were
   recorded every 15 min. Plasma glucose (GLU) was measured every 30 min.
   Cognitive processing (SCWT) was measured post-EX and compared to
   baseline (BL). A subset of 8 subjects performed a normothermic (N)
   protocol (21 degrees C/ambient humidity) to ascertain how the exercise
   stimulus influenced hydration status and cognition without heat.
   Results: There were no significant differences between fluid conditions
   (W, E, E+C) for BM loss (Delta 2.5 +/- 0.2, 2.5 +/- 0.2, 2.3 +/- 0.2
   kg), fluid consumption (1.9 +/- 0.2, 1.9 +/- 0.2, 1.8 +/- 0.2L), pOsm
   (Delta 1.5 +/- 2.7, 2.2 +/- 2.4, 2.0 +/- 1.5 mmol/L), peak-PSI (7.5 +/-
   0.4, 7.0 +/- 0.6, 7.9 +/- 0.5), and peak-TC (38.7 +/- 0.1, 38.6 +/- 0.2,
   38.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C). GLU decreased significantly in W and E, whereas
   it increased above BL in E+C at 60, 90, and 120 min (P < 0.05). Compared
   to BL values (43.6 +/- 26 ms), SCWT performance significantly decreased
   in all conditions (463 +/- 93, 422 +/- 83, 140 +/- 52 ms, P < 0.05).
   Importantly, compared to W and E, the impairment in SCWT was
   significantly attenuated in E+C (P < 0.05). As expected, when compared
   to the heat-stress protocol (W, E, E+C), N resulted in lower BM loss,
   fluid consumption, and peak-PSI (1.1 +/- 0.1 kg, 1.2 +/- 0.7L, 4.8,
   respectively), and improved SCWT performance.
   Conclusions: These data are the first to suggest that, independent of
   supplementation variety, cognitive processing significantly decreases
   immediately following long-duration exercise in the heat in healthy
   humans. Compared to water and fluids supplemented with only
   electrolytes, fluids supplemented with carbohydrates significantly
   blunts this decrease in cognitive function.},

Title = {Life through a wider scope: Brook Trout (<i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i>)
   exhibit similar aerobic scope across a broad temperature range},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {99},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) have been widely introduced
   throughout the world and are often considered as direct competitors with
   native salmonid species. Metabolic rate is one metric we can examine to
   improve our understanding of how well fish perform in different
   habitats, including across temperature gradients, as metabolism can be
   directly influenced by environmental temperatures in ectotherms. We
   estimated the standard metabolic rate, maximum metabolic rate, and
   aerobic scope of lab-reared juvenile Brook Trout (similar to 1 year)
   using intermittent-flow respirometry across a range of temperatures
   (5-23 degrees C) likely experienced in the wild. We included a diurnal
   temperature cycle of +/- 1.5 degrees C for each treatment temperature to
   simulate temporal variation observed in natural waterbodies. Standard
   metabolic rate and maximum metabolic rate both increased with
   acclimation temperature before appearing to plateau around 20 degrees C,
   while mass specific aerobic scope was found to increase from a mean of
   287.25 +/- 13.03 mg O2.kg(-1).h (-1) at 5 degrees C to 384.85 +/- 13.31
   mg O2.kg(-1).h (-1) at 15 degrees C before dropping at higher
   temperatures. Although a slight peak was found at 15 degrees C, the
   generally flat thermal performance curve for aerobic scope suggests
   Brook Trout are capable of adjusting to a relatively wide range of
   thermal regimes, appearing to be eurythermal, or a thermal generalist,
   at least for salmonids. The ability of this population to maintain
   similar physiological performance across a wide range of temperatures
   may help explain why Brook Trout succeed in a variety of different
   thermal habitats.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to compare the effects of ice slurry ingestion on
   post-exercise cooling in males and females. Twenty-four healthy adults
   (male n = 12; body weight {[}BW], 65.8 +/- 10.3 kg; female, n = 12; BW,
   58.2 +/- 10.0 kg) participated in this study. Participants ingested 7.5
   g/kg of either ice slurry at -1 degrees C (ICE) or control fluid at 20
   degrees C (CON) during recovery after cycling at 55\% VO2max until the
   rectal temperature reached 38.5 degrees C or exhaustion in a hot
   environment (controlled at 38 degrees C, 40\% relative humidity). Rectal
   (Tre) and skin (Tsk) temperature, ratings of thermal sensation (TS),
   thermal comfort (TC), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and
   whole body sweat loss (WBSL) were measured 60 min after exercise. Ice
   slurry ingestion reduced Tre and TS and improved post-exercise
   hypotension only in females (p < 0.05). In comparison, males did not
   receive cooling effect from post- exercise cooling with ice slurry
   ingestion. WBSL tended to be lower in ICE than CON in males (ICE, 454.3
   +/- 172.3 g; CON, 539.7 +/- 157.2 g; p = 0.065). In conclusion, sex
   differences were observed in the effects of post-exercise cooling with

Title = {Long term genetic selection for reproductive success affects neonatal
   lamb vitality across cold stress conditions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {98},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Adverse weather conditions are important contributors to mortality in
   new-born lambs. Previous studies have shown variation between lambs in
   their ability to cope with circumstances of cold stress, and genetic
   selection could be a viable option for improving animal robustness. The
   Elsenburg Merino flock was divergently selected on number of lambs
   weaned (NLW). This resulted in divergent responses in reproduction and
   lamb survival. This study evaluated lamb vitality and mortality of
   positively selected H-Line relative to the negatively selected L-Line in
   response to cold stress. Traits included lamb rectal temperature (RT),
   surface temperature (ST), shiver score (SS), lamb vigor score (LVS),
   breaths per minute (BPM), mortality to three days of age (M3) and to
   weaning (TM). Cold stress was described by a chill index derived from
   daily rainfall, wind speed and ambient temperature, and represented as
   the mean of the one (CI), two (CI-2) or three (CI-3) days since
   parturition. Overall, HLine lambs had a higher neonatal RT and were less
   likely to succumb than L-Line contemporaries. In a significant (P <
   0.05) interaction, the predicted RT of L-Line showed a non-linear
   decline with increased levels of CI-2, while H-Line lambs better
   maintained their core temperature. M3 was also affected by a significant
   interaction between CI-3 and selection line, further suggesting that
   observed lower mortality rates in the H-Line depends on H-Line lambs'
   improved ability to cope with stressful environments. Long term
   selection for NLW in the H-Line led to improvements in both adaptations
   associated with lower lamb losses. The continued recording of viability
   traits to produce larger datasets amenable to genetic analysis is
   recommended, specifically for rectal temperature.},

Title = {How will climate change impact fossorial lizard species? Two examples in
   the Baja California Peninsula},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {95},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Global climate change and the associated erosion of habitat suitability
   are pervasive threats to biodiversity. It is critical to identify
   specific stressors to assess a species vulnerability to extinction,
   especially in species with distinctive natural histories. Here, we
   present a combination of field, laboratory, and modeling approaches to
   evaluate the potential consequences of climate change on two endemic,
   fossorial lizards species (Anniella geronimensis and Bipes biporus) from
   Baja California, Mexico. We also include soil type in our models to
   refine the suitable areas using our mechanistic models. Results suggest
   that both species are at high risk of extinction by global climate
   change based on the thermal habitat suitability. The forecast for
   species persistence is most grave under the RCP8.5 scenario. On the one
   hand, suitable habitat for A. geronimensis diminishes at its southern
   distribution, but potential suitable expands towards the north. On the
   other hand, the suitable habitat for B. biporus will contract
   significantly with a concomitant reduction in its potential
   distribution. Because both species have low mobility and are restricted
   to low elevation, the potential for elevational and latitudinal
   dispersal to mitigate extinction risk along the Baja California
   Peninsula is unlikely. In addition each species has specialized thermal
   requirements (i.e., stenothermic) and soil type preferences to which
   they are adapted. Our ecophysiological models in combination with the
   type of soil are fundamental in developing conservation strategies.},

Title = {Formulae for calculating body surface area in modern US Army Soldiers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {92},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: Body surface area (BSA) is an important measurement for many
   thermophysiological, pharmaceutical, toxicological, environmental, and
   military applications. Unfortunately, BSA is difficult to quantify, and
   existing prediction methods are not optimized for contemporary
   populations.
   Methods: The present study analyzed data body measurements from 5603
   male and female participants of a US Army Anthropometric Survey to
   determine optimal methods for estimating BSA in modern US Army Soldiers.
   This data included 94 individual body measurements as well as three
   dimensional (3D) whole body scans for each participant. We used this
   data to assess and compared 15 existing equations to the measured data.
   We also derived best fitting nonlinear regression models for estimating
   BSA from different combinations of sex, height, and weight and
   iteratively included the remaining 91 measurements to determine which
   combinations resulted in the highest goodness-of-fit.
   Results: We found that inclusion of armspan measurements as a third body
   dimension maximized the model goodness-of-fit.
   Conclusion: Some of the existing formulae provide reasonable estimates
   of 3D-scanner derived BSA; while our new formulae derived from this
   study allows for more accurate estimates of BSA using one or more common
   input variables.},

Title = {Thermal preferences of subtropical <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and temperate
   <i>Ae</i>. <i>japonicus</i> mosquitoes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Temperature is an important determinant affecting the capacity of
   disease vectors like mosquitoes (Culicidae) to transmit disease agents.
   Although the impact of temperature on vector-borne disease dynamics has
   been studied intensively, the actual temperature encountered by the
   vector in a heterogeneous landscape is rarely taken into account. If
   disease vectors have temperature preferences and therefore select
   specific microhabitats, this would substantially influence key life
   history traits that determine transmission intensity. The thermal
   preferences of subtropical Aedes aegypti and temperate Ae. japonicus
   mosquitoes were investigated in a temperature gradient setup consisting
   of a Plexiglas box on top of an aluminium plate on two thermal
   regulators. Blood-fed (one day after feeding) and unfed (non-blood-fed)
   mosquitoes were released in small (15-20 degrees C, 20-25 degrees C,
   25-30 degrees C) and large (15-30 degrees C, 30-45 degrees C)
   temperature gradients to assess their thermal preferences after 15 min.
   Additionally, the effect of humidity was investigated in a two-choice
   chamber setup. Both mosquito species avoided higher temperatures,
   pronouncedly dangerously high temperatures in the 30-45 degrees C
   gradient. At lower temperatures, blood-fed mosquitoes preferred the
   cooler sides of the 20-25 degrees C and 25-30 degrees C gradient, which
   were all below their rearing temperature. In the lowest gradient of
   15-20 degrees C, no preferences were found. The thermal preference of
   unfed mosquitoes was similar to that of the blood-fed mosquitoes. No
   humidity preference or effect of humidity on temperature preferences was
   observed within the tested range (40-90\%). The set-up allows for
   assessing the thermal preference of mosquitoes under controlled
   conditions. The observed preference of mosquitoes for cooler
   temperatures would increase their longevity and slow down pathogen
   development. If similar micmhabitat selection is observed in the field,
   vector borne disease models should be adjusted accordingly.},

Title = {Thermal plasticity in the invasive south American tomato pinworm <i>Tuta
   absoluta</i> (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {90},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera:
   Gelechiidae) is a devastating invasive global insect pest of tomato,
   Solanum lycopersicum (Solanaceae). In nature, pests face multiple
   overlapping environmental stressors, which may significantly influence
   survival. To cope with rapidly changing environments, insects often
   employ a suite of mechanisms at both acute and chronic time-scales,
   thereby improving fitness at sub-optimal thermal environments. For T.
   absoluta, physiological responses to transient thermal variability
   remain under explored. Moreso, environmental effects and physiological
   responses may differ across insect life stages and this can have
   implications for population dynamics. Against this background, we
   investigated short and long term plastic responses to temperature of T.
   absoluta larvae (4th instar) and adults (24-48 h old) from field
   populations. We measured traits of temperature tolerance vis critical
   thermal limits {[}critical thermal minima (CTmin) and maxima (CTmax)],
   heat knockdown time (HKDT), chill coma recovery time (CCRT) and
   supercooling points (SCP). Our results showed that at the larval stage,
   Rapid Cold Hardening (RCH) significantly improved CTmin and HKDT but
   impaired SCP and CCRT. Heat hardening in larvae impaired CTmin, CCRT,
   SCP, CTmax but not HKDT. In adults, both heat and cold hardening
   generally impaired CTmin and CTmax, but had no effects on HKDT, SCP and
   CCRT. Low temperature acclimation significantly improved CTmin and HKDT
   while marginally compromising CCRT and CTmax, whereas high temperature
   acclimation had no significant effects on any traits except for HKDT in
   larvae. Similarly, low and high temperature acclimation had no effects
   on CTmin, SCPs and CTmax, while high temperature acclimation
   significantly compromised adult CCRT. Our results show that larvae are
   more thermally plastic than adults and can shift their thermal tolerance
   in short and long timescales. The larval plasticity reported here could
   be advantageous in new envirnments, suggesting an asymmetrical
   ecological role of larva relative to adults in facilitating T. absoluta
   invasion.},

Abstract = {Exposure to cold and hot temperatures is known to have negative impacts
   on human health. It is the aim of the present study to assess the health
   effects of cold and hot temperatures on the population living in the
   city of Isfahan. Daily data on average temperature and mortalities
   during the nine-year period 2008-2016 were obtained. Mortalities were
   stratified by causes (non-accidental, cardiovascular, respiratory, and
   stroke) and by age groups (0-14 years, 15-64 years, and >= 65 years). A
   standard time-series analysis was conducted using the Poisson model for
   cause-age-specific mortality effects of temperature, adjusted for
   seasonal and long-term trends as well as day of the week. Moreover, a
   distributed non-linear lag model (DNLM) with a 21-day lag time was used
   to determine the cumulative effects of cold and hot temperatures on
   mortality using the minimum mortality temperature (hereafter MMT) as the
   reference. A meta-analytical model was then used to pool the data thus
   obtained. Extreme temperatures were defied using cutoffs at 2.5th and
   97.5th temperature percentiles and mortalities were reported as
   attributable to temperatures below and above MMT. A U-shaped curve was
   derived capturing the relationship between average temperature, on the
   one hand, and all the age and all the mortality cause groups, on the
   other. MMT was found to vary substantially for different age and cause
   groupings. Both cold and hot temperatures were found to increase the
   mortality risks, with a stronger effect of extreme temperatures. Cold
   temperature was responsible for a higher portion of the mortality than
   heat was. The cold effect on respiratory and stroke mortalities was
   higher than that on non-accidental and cardiovascular mortalities.
   Exposure to cold and hot temperatures increased relative risks of
   mortality in all age and cause groupings in Isfahan. Our findings can
   have important implications for mortality prevention in Isfahan.},

Title = {The effect of small-scale morphology on thermal dynamics in coral
   microenvironments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The thermal microenvironments of corals is a topic of current interest
   given their relationship to coral bleaching. We present computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD) model of corals with both smooth and rugged polyp
   surface topographies for two species of massive corals (Leptastrea
   purpurea and Platygyra sinensis) in order to predict their microscale
   surface warming. This study explores whether variation in polyp depth
   (PD) may directly effect a coral overall surface area-to-volume (A/V)
   ratio and consequently its surface warming. Validation of our models was
   made against detailed laboratory measurements of coral surface warming
   and thermal boundary layer thickness. Our results suggested that while
   differences in surface warming exist between smooth surfaces and
   surfaces covered in micro-polyps (5 mm depth), the variation in terms of
   surface warming is small ((similar to)0.18-0.19 degrees C) and it can be
   largely attributed to increasing A/V ratios. Our results demonstrated
   good agreement with measurements of surface temperatures on living
   corals and that ignoring the presence of polyps by modelling heat
   transfer associated with a smooth surface makes no material difference
   to the values obtained or the interpretation of the processes leading to
   surface warming.},

   Comparisons between persons with and without exertional heat stroke},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is a leading cause of preventable morbidity
   and mortality among both athletes and warfighters. Therefore, it is
   important to find blood biomarkers to predict susceptibility to EHS. We
   compared gene expression profiling from blood cells between two groups
   of participants - those with and those without a history EHS - by using
   genome-wide microarray analysis. Subjects with a history of EHS (n = 6)
   and non-EHS controls without a history of EHS (n = 18) underwent a heat
   tolerance test and a thermoneutral exercise challenge on separate days.
   The heat tolerance test comprised of 2-h of walking, at 5 km/h and 2\%
   incline, with ambient conditions set at 40 degrees C, 40\% relative
   humidity; the thermoneutral test was similar, but had ambient conditions
   set at 22 degrees C. Next, we examined gene expression profiles,
   quantified based on arithmetic differences (post minus pre) during the
   heat test minus changes during the thermoneutral test. Genes related to
   interleukins and cellular stress were significantly down-regulated in
   participants with a history of EHS compared to their non-EHS
   counterparts. Suppression of these genes may be associated with
   susceptibility to exertional heat injury. Prospective research is
   required to determine whether similar gene expression profiling can be
   potentially used as blood biomarkers to predict susceptibility to EHS.},

Abstract = {Long-term assessments of bio-thermal responses in a hair coat sheep
   breed were performed to investigate the effect of the thermal
   environment on their physiological performance and thermal balance.
   Twelve healthy non-lactating Morada Nova ewes (3 +/- 1.2 years old, body
   mass 32.7 +/- 3.7 kg) were assigned in two 12 x 12 Latin square designs
   (from 07:00 to 19:00 h and from 19:00 to 07:00 h, respectively) for
   assessments of their biothermal responses during 24 consecutive days.
   There was a monophasic pattern in the ambient temperature (T-A), which
   ranged between 21 and 38 degrees C, thereby exposing the ewes to
   different levels of surrounding T-A over the day and influencing several
   of their bio-thermal responses (P = 0.0001). Their body temperatures
   (i.e., rectal, skin, and hair coat surface temperatures) gradually
   increased (P = 0.0001) from 04:00 h. The mean peak for rectal
   temperature (39.3 degrees C) was recorded at 19:00 h, while for skin and
   hair coat surface temperatures it occurred at 13:00 and 14:00 h,
   respectively. The sensible heat loss by long wave radiation and surface
   convection exceeded the metabolism of ewes when the T-A was below 24
   degrees C, which usually occurred between 24:00 and 06:00 h. During
   exposure to higher ambient temperatures, the sheep increased respiratory
   evaporative heat loss, without panting. In conclusion, the sheep
   regulated rectal temperature within a relatively narrow range of 1.4
   degrees C over 24 h, and appear to be well adapted to coping with heat.
   Minimum 24 h body temperature was correlated with minimum T-A,
   indicating that heat conservation strategies are likely to be important
   for Morada Nova sheep in a tropical biotype at night, when rates of
   sensible heat loss exceed the heat generated by metabolism.},

Title = {Acclimation capability inferred by metabolic performance in two sea
   cucumber species from different latitudes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {84},
Pages = {407-413},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The notion that thermal specialists from tropical regions live closer to
   their temperature limits than temperate eurytherms, seems too
   generalized. Species specific differences in physiological and
   biochemical stress reactions are linked to key components of organism
   fitness, like metabolic capacity, which indicates that acclimation
   potential across latitudes might be highly diverse rather than
   simplistic. In this study the exposure of a tropical (Holothuria scabra)
   and a temperate (Holothuria forskali) sea cucumber species to identical
   cold- and warm-acclimation stress was compared using the key metabolic
   parameters, respiration rate, enzyme activity (ETS, LDH, IDH), and
   energy reserve fractions (lipid, carbohydrate and protein). Results show
   much broader respiratory adjustments, as response to temperature change,
   in H. scabra (2-30 mu gO(2){*}gww(-1){*}h(-1)) compared to H. forskali
   (1.5-6.6 mu gO(2){*}gww(-1){*}h(-1)). Moreover, the tropical species
   showed clearly pronounced up and down regulation of metabolic enzymes
   and shifts in energy reserves, due to thermal acclimation, while the
   same metabolic indicators remained consistent in the temperate species.
   In summary, these findings indicate enhanced metabolic plasticity in H.
   scabra at the cost of elevated energy expenditures, which seems to favor
   the tropical stenotherm in terms of thermal acclimation capacity. The
   comparison of such holistic metabolic analyses between conspecifics and
   congeners, may help to predict the heterogeneous effects of global
   temperature changes across latitudinal gradients.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of floor space and betaine
   supplementation on the nutrient digestibility and performance of laying
   quail, at an advanced stage of production, in a tropical environment. In
   total, 408 laying quail (23 weeks old) were distributed in 3 x 2
   factorial arrangements with four replicates. The first factor was floor
   space (250 cm(2) {[}FS-1], 221 cm(2) {[}FS-2], and 200 cm(2) per bird
   {[}FS-3]) by allocating 15, 17, and 19 birds per cage (cage size: 3750
   cm(2)). The second factor was betaine supplementation, administered at
   levels of 0 (Control) and 0.12\% (Betaine). The birds were housed under
   a natural, tropical environment that was outside the predominant
   thermoneutral zone, indicating heat stress conditions. Interactions were
   found between floor space and betaine on crude fiber digestibility, egg
   production, and eggshell thickness, with the highest values being
   yielded in FS-2 group supplemented with betaine. Reducing the floor
   space to 200 cm(2) negatively affected nutrient digestibility and
   performance. The birds kept in FS-3 had lower (P < 0.05) dry matter,
   crude protein, crude fat, and calcium digestibility values than those
   kept in FS-1 and FS-2. Birds housed in FS-2 exhibited higher egg weight
   than those in FS-3 (P < 0.05), although they did not differ from those
   in FS-1. Furthermore, a lower eggshell weight in FS-3, compared with
   FS-1 and FS-2, was observed (P < 0.01). Betaine supplementation enhanced
   the dry matter, crude protein, crude fat, crude ash, and calcium
   digestibility values (P < 0.05). Accordingly, betaine improved feed
   intake, egg weight, feed conversion, and protein and energy efficiency
   ratios (P < 0.01). Betaine also resulted in higher albumen, yolk, and
   eggshell weights (P < 0.01). In conclusion, a floor space of 221 cm(2),
   combined with betaine supplementation at 0.12\%, can be applied for
   raising quail under high environmental temperatures.},

Abstract = {Currently, 18 {[}F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) in combination with a
   positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan analysis
   is the most commonly used method to quantify human BAT volume and
   activity. However, this technique presents several drawbacks which
   negatively affect participant's health. The aim of the present work is
   to determine whether supraclavicular skin temperature can be used as an
   indirect marker of cold-induced BAT and skeletal muscle F-18-FDG uptake
   in adults, while taking into account body composition. We performed a
   personalized cooling protocol just before an F-18-FDG-PET/CT scan, and
   we measured supraclavicular skin temperature before (in warm conditions)
   and after the cooling protocol in 88 adults (n = 57 women, mean age:
   21.9 +/- 2.1 years old, body mass index: 24.5 +/- 4.3 km/m(2)). We found
   that supraclavicular skin temperature at the warm and cold periods was
   weakly and positively associated with BAT activity (SUVmean and SUVpeak:
   beta = 3.000; R-2 = 0.072; P = 0.022 and beta = 2.448; R-2 = 0.060; P =
   0.021), but not with skeletal muscle F-18-FDG uptake, after controlling
   for body composition. We performed further analyses and the positive
   associations persisted only in the group of women. In conclusion,
   supraclavicular skin temperature in warm and cold conditions seems to be
   related with cold-induced F-18-FDG uptake by BAT only in women, although
   the low explained variance of these associations means that there are
   other factors involved in the supraclavicular skin temperature.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to assess solar radiation transmission and animal
   thermal comfort indexes in two silvopastoral systems established with
   different tree arrangements in a tropical region. This study was
   conducted between 2014 and 2017 in two silvopastoral systems, one
   composed by an established Urochloa (syn. Brachiaria) decumbens pasture
   with Brazilian native trees planted in triple rows spaced 17 m apart,
   and another by an established Urochloa (syn. Brachiaria) brizantha
   (Hochst ex A. Rich.) Stapf \%RS Plata' pasture with Eucalyptus
   urograndis (clone GG100) trees arranged in single rows spaced 15 m
   apart. In these systems and in a full-sun pasture, photosynthetically
   active radiation transmission, air temperature, relative humidity, black
   globe temperature, and wind speed were measured. These variables were
   used to calculate black globe temperature and humidity index (BGHI) and
   radiant thermal load (RU). Higher animal thermal comfort was observed in
   the silvopastoral systems due to changes in the microclimate induced by
   the trees; notably, a decrease in solar radiation transmission. Fewer
   hours of potential animal thermal stress (BGHI > 79) were observed in
   the silvopastoral systems than under the full-sun conditions, with
   differences up to 3 h per day. The silvopastoral systems presented lower
   radiant thermal load than the full-sun pasture with differences up to
   22\% achieved. The assessed silvopastoral systems may help livestock
   adapt to climate change, since they achieved the limit of BGHI
   considered to cause stress to animals following an increase of 2.2
   degrees C in air temperature, compared with full-sun pastures.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a GPU parallel algorithm for brain
   tumor detection to estimate its size and location from surface
   temperature distribution obtained by thermography. The normal brain
   tissue is modeled as a rectangular cube including spherical tumor. The
   temperature distribution is calculated using forward three dimensional
   Pennes bioheat transfer equation, it's solved using massively parallel
   Finite Difference Method (FDM) and implemented on Graphics Processing
   Unit (GPU). Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used to solve the inverse problem
   and estimate the tumor size and location by minimizing an objective
   function involving measured temperature on the surface to those obtained
   by numerical simulation. The parallel implementation of Finite
   Difference Method reduces significantly the time of bioheat transfer and
   greatly accelerates the inverse identification of brain tumor
   thermophysical and geometrical properties. Experimental results show
   significant gains in the computational speed on GPU and achieve a
   speedup of around 41 compared to the CPU. The analysis performance of
   the estimation based on tumor size inside brain tissue also presented.},

Title = {Interacting effects of ambient temperature and food quality on the
   foraging ecology of small mammalian herbivores},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {83-90},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Both temperature and diet quality play an important role in the time and
   energy budgets of small mammalian herbivores. However, little is known
   about how temperature and diet quality interact to influence diet
   selection, nutrient extraction, and energetics, and how these effects
   might differ among species. Therefore, we examined the effects of diet
   quality and temperature on aspects of the foraging ecology of two
   species of lagomorphs, pygmy rabbits (Brachyiagus idahoensis), which are
   small dietary specialists, and mountain cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus
   nuttallii), which are larger dietary and habitat generalists. In a
   series of feeding experiments, we investigated 1) the effects of
   temperature on selection of plant fiber and the plant secondary
   metabolite 1,8 cineole in their diets, 2) effects of temperature and
   plant fiber on daily intake, digestion, and passage of food, 3) effects
   of plant fiber and 1,8 cineole on resting metabolic rate, and 4) how
   these interactions differ between the rabbit species. Both species chose
   to eat more total food and a greater proportion of high fiber food that
   passed more quickly through the digestive system in colder temperatures.
   However, temperature did not affect how much 1,8 cineole the rabbits
   consumed nor how thoroughly they digested food. Food quality affected
   how well they digested the dry matter in the food, but not their resting
   metabolic rate. Understanding how the interactions between ambient
   temperature and food quality affect selection of diets and intake by
   small mammalian herbivores, and the physiological mechanisms governing
   these choices, is useful for predicting how these species might respond
   to changes in both temperature and food quality and inform conservation
   and restoration strategies.},

Title = {Locomotor and energetic consequences of behavioral thermoregulation in
   the sanguivorous leech Hirudo verbana},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Medicinal leeches (Hirudo uerbana) thermoregulate with respect to their
   sanguivorous feeding behavior. Immediate postprandial preferences are
   for warmer than their initial acclimation temperature (T-a, 21 degrees
   C, Petersen et al. 2011), while unfed leeches have a lower preferred
   temperature (T-pref 12.5 degrees C). This may reduce energy expenditure
   and defer starvation if feeding opportunities are limited. Energetic
   benefits may have an associated cost if low temperatures reduce mobility
   and the ability to locate further hosts. These costs could be limited if
   mobility is unimpaired at low temperatures, or if acclimation can
   restore locomotor performance to the levels at T-a. The transition from
   T-a to the unfed T-pref significantly reduced speed and propulsive cycle
   frequency during swimming, and extension and retraction rates during
   crawling. Aerobic metabolic rate was also reduced from 0.20 +/- 0.03 W
   kg(-1) at Ta to 0.10 +/- 0.03 W kg(-1) at T-pref The Q(10), values of
   1.7-2.9 for energetic and swimming parameters indicate a substantial
   temperature effect, although part of the decline in swimming performance
   can be attributed to temperature-related changes in water viscosity. 6
   weeks at To resulted in no detectable acclimation in locomotor
   performance or aerobic metabolism. The energetic savings associated with
   a lower T-pref in unfed leeches effectively doubled the estimated time
   until depletion of energy reserves. Given that some mobility is still
   retained at T-pref and that acclimation is in itself costly, the
   energetic benefits of selecting cooler temperatures between feedings may
   outweigh the costs associated with reduced locomotor performance.},

Abstract = {Thermal adaptation predicts that thermal sensitivity of physiological
   traits should be optimized to thermal conditions most frequently
   experienced. Furthermore, thermodynamic constraints predict that species
   with higher thermal optima should have higher performance maxima and
   narrower performance breadths. We tested these predictions by examining
   the thermal sensitivity of energy assimilation between populations
   within two species of terrestrial-lungless salamanders, Plethodon
   albagula and P. montanus. Within P. albagula, we examined populations
   that were latitudinally separated by > 450 km. Within P. montanus, we
   examined populations that were elevationally separated by > 900 m.
   Thermal sensitivity of energy assimilation varied substantially between
   populations of P. albagula separated latitudinally, but did not vary
   between populations of P. montanus separated elevationally.
   Specifically, in P. albagula, the lower latitude population Had a higher
   thermal optimum, higher maximal performance, and narrower performance
   breadth compared to the higher latitude population. Furthermore, across
   all individuals as thermal optima increased, performance maxima also
   increased, providing support for the theory that ``hotter is better{''}.},

Title = {Expression of HSP70 genes in skin of zebu (Tharparkar) and crossbred

Abstract = {Skin is most important environmental interface providing a protective
   envelope to animals. It's always under the influence of both internal
   and external stressors. Heat shock proteins (HSP) are highly conserved
   stress proteins which play crucial roles in environmental stress
   tolerance and thermal adaptation. Present study was planned to observe
   the relative mRNA expression of inducible (HSP70.1 and HSP70.2) and
   constitutive (HSP70.8) HSP in skin of zebu (Tharparkar) and crossbred
   (Karan Fries) cattle during different seasons. Skin biopsies were
   collected from rump region of each animal, aseptically during winter,
   spring and summer season. Quantitative real time polymerase chain
   reaction was performed to examine the gene expression of constitutive
   (HSP70.8) and inducible (HSP70.1 and HSP70.2) HSP in skin of both the
   breeds during different seasons. Present study observed higher
   expression of both constitutive and inducible HSP genes in both the
   breeds during summer and winter than spring season, but magnitude of
   increase was higher during summer than winter. During summer season,
   expression pattern of HSP5 in skin showed breed differences, where
   constitutive HSP expression was higher in Tharparkar than Karan Fries
   and that of inducible HSP was higher in Karan Fries than Tharparkar.
   Hence, present study suggested that HSP may be conveniently used as
   biomarkers for assessing protective response of skin against heat stress
   in zebu and crossbred cattle. Variation in expression between breeds is
   associated with their heat tolerance and thermal adaptability. In
   summary, skin of zebu cattle (Tharparkar) is more resistant to summer
   stress than crossbred (Karan Fries), providing greater protection
   against heat stress during summer season. Superior skin protective
   mechanism of zebu (Tharparkar) than crossbred (Karan-Fries) cattle
   against heat stress may contribute to superior adaptability of zebu
   cattle to tropical climatic conditions than crossbreed.},

Abstract = {The effect of temperature on the development and survival of
   Cephalonomia tarsalis (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae), larval
   ectoparasitoid of beetles of Oryzaephilus sp. (Coleoptera: Silvanidae)
   was studied in the laboratory. Durations of the development of the egg,
   larva and pupa were measured in eight constant temperatures (15, 17.5,
   20, 25, 30, 32.5, 35 and 37.5 degrees C) parasitizing larvae of the
   saw-toothed beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) (Coleoptera:
   Silvanidae). The duration of development was decreased with temperature
   increase within the range 17.5-32.5 degrees C. Survival was higher when
   immatures were exposed to medium temperatures (20-30 degrees C) compared
   with those lived in a more extreme temperature regime ( <20 and > 30
   degrees C). Wasps failed to complete their development at 15 and 37.5
   degrees C. Thermal parameters (upper, lower and optimum developmental
   threshold, thermal constant) were estimated by fitting the linear and a
   non-linear (Logan I) model to our data. Upper and lower developmental
   thresholds ranged between 35.1-37.0 degrees C and 13.2-13.8 degrees C,
   respectively. The optimum temperature for development was estimated
   between 33.6 degrees C and 34.6 degrees C. Tests for developmental rate
   isomorphy (DRI) showed that change in the average proportion of time
   spent in each developmental stage was marginally significant, proving
   that development of C. tarsalis is probably incompatible with DRI.
   However, this conclusion is questionable given that lower developmental
   thresholds did not differ significantly among various developmental
   stages (bootstrap test). Thermal constant for total development was
   calculated 212.4 degree-days. Our results are discussed not only on the
   basis of thermal biology, but also of improving the efficiency of C
   tarsalis as biocontrol agent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Thermoregulatory strategies in an aquatic ectotherm from
   thermally-constrained habitats: An evaluation of current approaches},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {52},
Pages = {97-107},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Many ectotherms employ diverse behavioral adjustments to effectively
   buffer the spatio-temporal variation in environmental temperatures,
   whereas others remain passive to thermal heterogeneity. Thermoregulatory
   studies are frequently performed on species living in thermally benign
   habitats, which complicate understanding of the
   thermoregulation-thermoconformity continuum. The need for new empirical
   data from ectotherms exposed to thermally challenging conditions
   requires the evaluation of available methods for quantifying
   thermoregulatory strategies. We evaluated the applicability of various
   thermoregulatory indices using fire salamander larvae, Salamandra
   salamandra, in two aquatic habitats, a forest pool and well, as examples
   of disparate thermally-constrained environments. Water temperatures in
   the well were lower and less variable than in the pool. Thermal
   conditions prevented larvae from reaching their preferred body
   temperature range in both water bodies. In contrast to their
   thermoregulatory abilities examined in a laboratory thermal gradient,
   field body temperatures only matched the mean and range of operative
   temperatures, showing thermal passivity of larvae in both habitats.
   Despite apparent thermoconformity, thermoregulatory indices indicated
   various strategies from active thermoregulation, to thermoconformity,
   and even thermal evasion, which revealed their limited applicability
   under thermally-constrained conditions. Salamander larvae abandoned
   behavioral thermoregulation despite varying opportunities to increase
   their body temperature above average water temperatures.
   Thermoconformity represents a favored strategy in these ectotherms
   living in more thermally-constrained environments than those examined in
   previous thermoregulatory studies. To understand thermal ecology and its
   impact on population dynamics, the quantification of thermoregulatory
   strategies of ectotherms in thermally-constrained habitats requires the
   careful choice of an appropriate method to avoid misleading results. (C)

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Yaks adapt to extremely low temperatures, but they are more susceptible
   to heat stress (HS). The adaptive mechanisms with crucial plasma protein
   markers regulating the response to HS remain elusive. In this study,
   data-independent acquisition proteomics were used to evaluate the
   thermal adaptability under chronic HS and thermal-neutral conditions. As
   a result, yaks increased body temperatures and respiratory rates in
   response to HS. Eight differential proteins mainly related to
   vasodilatation were decreased by HS, but another four proteins
   associated with blood oxygen delivery were presented at higher levels.
   Complement and coagulation cascades pathway was activated by HS, and
   more proteins were upregulated to protect against inflammation and
   oxidative stress by higher levels of antioxidant proteins. It is likely
   that yaks react to HS with enhancement of immunomodulation,
   anti-oxidation, and blood oxygen delivery, which is conducive to taking
   appropriate environment and nutrition management strategies to get
   healthy and high-performing yaks in low-altitude regions during summer.},

Title = {How turtles keep their cool: Seasonal and diel basking patterns in a
   tropical turtle},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {121},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Behavioural thermoregulation by ectotherms is an important mechanism for
   maintaining body temperatures to optimise physiological performance.
   Experimental studies suggest that nocturnal basking by Krefft's river
   turtles (Emydura macquarii krefftii) in the tropics may allow them to
   avoid high water temperatures, however, this hypothesis has yet to be
   tested in the field. In this study, we examined the influence of
   environmental temperature on seasonal and diel patterns of basking in E.
   m. krefftii in tropical north Queensland, Australia. Wildlife cameras
   were used to document turtle basking events for seven consecutive days
   and nights for each month over a year (April 2020-March 2021). Air and
   water temperatures were recorded simultaneously using temperature
   loggers. We used a negative binomial mixed effects model to compare mean
   basking durations (min) occurring among four environmental temperature
   categories based on population thermal preference (26 degrees C): 1) air
   temperature above and water temperature below preferred temperature; 2)
   air temperature below and water temperature above preferred temperature;
   3) air and water temperatures both above preferred temperature; and 4)
   air and water temperatures both below preferred temperature. Basking
   behaviour was influenced significantly by the relationship between air
   and water temperature. During the day, turtles spent significantly less
   time basking when both air and water temperatures were above their
   preferred temperatures. Conversely, at night, turtles spent
   significantly more time basking when water temperatures were warm and
   air temperatures were cool relative to their preferred temperature. This
   study adds to the growing body of work indicating pronounced heat
   avoidance as a thermoregulatory strategy among tropical reptile
   populations.},

Abstract = {Hypoxic aquatic environments occur more frequently as a result of
   climate change, thereby exerting challenges on the physiological and
   metabolic functions of aquatic animals. In this study, a model fish,
   zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) was used to observe the climate -induced
   hypoxic effect on the upper thermal limit (critical thermal maximum;
   CTmax), hemoglobin, and blood glucose levels, and abnormalities of
   erythrocytes at cellular and nuclear level. The value of CTmax decreased
   significantly under hypoxia (39.10 +/- 0.96 degrees C) compared to
   normoxia (43.70 +/- 0.91 degrees C). At CTmax, hemoglobin levels were
   much lower (9.33 +/- 0.60 g/dL) and blood glucose levels were
   significantly higher (194.20 +/- 11.33 mg/L) under hypoxia than they
   were under normoxia and at the beginning of the experiment. Increased
   frequencies of abnormalities in the erythrocytes at both cellular
   (fusion, twin, elongated, spindle and tear drop shaped) and nuclear
   (micronucleus, karyopyknosis, binuclei, nuclear degeneration and notched
   nuclei) levels were also found under hypoxia compared to normoxia. These
   results suggest that hypoxic conditions significantly alter the
   temperature tolerance and subsequent physiology in zebrafish. Our
   findings will aid in the development of effective management techniques
   for aquatic environments with minimum oxygen availability.},

Abstract = {Small birds and mammals face similar energetic challenges, yet use of
   torpor to conserve energy while resting is considered less common among
   birds, especially within the most specious order Passeriformes. We
   conducted the first study to record the natural thermoregulatory
   physiology of any species from the family Hirundinidae, which we
   predicted would use torpor because of their specialised foraging by
   aerial pursuit of flying insects, that are less active during cold or
   windy weather. We used temperature telemetry on wild -living welcome
   swallows ( Hirundo neoxena , 13 to 17 g) and found that skin temperature
   declined during nightly resting by an average by 5 degrees C, from
   daytime minima of 41.0 +/- 0.8 degrees C to nightly minima of 36.3 +/-
   0.8 degrees C, and by a maximum of 8 degrees C to a minimum recorded
   skin temperature of 32.0 degrees C. The extent of reduction in skin
   temperature was greater on cold nights and following windy daytime
   (foraging) periods. Further, we found that transmitters glued directly
   to the skin between feather tracts (i.e., an apterium) provided a less
   variable and probably also more accurate reflection of body temperature
   than transmitters applied over closely trimmed feathers. A moderate
   decrease in skin temperature, equivalent to shallow torpor, would
   provide energy savings during rest. Yet, deeper torpor was not observed,
   despite a period of extreme rainfall that presumedly decreased foraging
   success. Further studies are needed to understand the resting
   thermoregulatory energetics of swallows under different environmental
   conditions. We advocate the importance of measuring thermal biology in
   wild -living birds to increase our knowledge of the physiology and
   ecological importance of torpor among passerine birds.},

Title = {Anti-oxidant effects of herbal residue from Shengxuebao mixture on
   heat-stressed New Zealand rabbits},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {119},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Heat stress can lead to hormonal imbalances, weakened immune system,
   increased metabolic pressure on the liver, and ultimately higher animal
   mortality rates. This not only seriously impairs the welfare status of
   animals, but also causes significant economic losses to the livestock
   industry. Due to its rich residual bioactive components and good safety
   characteristics, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) residue is expected
   to become a high-quality feed additive with anti-oxidative stress
   alleviating function. This study focuses on the potential of Shengxuebao
   mixture herbal residue (SXBR) as an anti-heat stress feed additive.
   Through the UPLC (ultra performance liquid chromatography) technology,
   the average residue rate of main active ingredients from SXBR were found
   to be 25.39\%. SXBR were then added into the basal diet of heat stressed
   New Zealand rabbits at the rates of 5\% (SXBRl), 10\% (SXBRm) and 20\%
   (SXBRh). Heat stress significantly decreased the weight gain, as well as
   increased neck and ear temperature, drip loss in meat, inflammation and
   oxidative stress. Also, the hormone levels were disrupted, with a
   significant increase in serum levels of CA, COR and INS. After the
   consumption of SXBR in the basal diet for 3 weeks, the weight of New
   Zealand rabbits increased significantly, and the SXBRh group restored
   the redness value of the meat to a similar level as the control group.
   Furthermore, the serum levels T3 thyroid hormone in the SXBRh group and
   T4 thyroid hormone in the SXBRm group increased significantly, the SXBRh
   group showed a significant restoration in inflammation markers (IL-1
   beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) and oxidative stress markers (total
   antioxidant capacity, HSP-70, MDA, and ROS) levels. Moreover, the
   real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR analysis found that, the
   expression levels of antioxidant genes such as Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, and
   GPX1 were significantly upregulated in the SXBRh group, and the
   expression level of the Keap1 gene was significantly downregulated.
   Additionally, the SXBRm group showed significant upregulation in the
   expression levels of HO-1 and NQO1 genes. Western blot experiments
   further confirmed the up-regulation of Nrf2, Ho-1 and NQO1 proteins.
   This study provides a strategy for the utilization of SXBR and is of
   great significance for the green recycling of the TCM residues,
   improving the development of animal husbandry and animal welfare.},

Title = {Assessment of vertical cooling performance of trees over different
   surface covers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {119},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Tree-induced cooling benefits are associated with various factors, such
   as canopy morphology, surface cover, and environmental configuration.
   However, limited studies have analyzed the sensitivity of tree-induced
   cooling effects to the combination of such factors. Most studies have
   focused on 1.5-m cooling performance, and few studies on the variability
   of the under-tree vertical cooling performance. Therefore, this study
   aims to investigate the vertical cooling performance of different
   combinations of trees and surface covers. The study was completed in
   Chongqing, China, with field experiments capturing vertical air
   temperature and wind speed at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 m under two
   typical combinations of ``tree + grass{''} (ComA) and ``tree +
   shrubs{''} (ComB), and capturing 1.5 m microclimatic environments of a
   control group with hard pavement without tree shade (REF). The results
   show that at an average ambient temperature of 33 degrees C, the maximum
   air-cooling temperatures for ComA and ComB were 2.46 degrees C and 1.78
   degrees C, respectively. An increase in the ambient temperature
   corresponded to a decrease in the cooling effect difference between ComA
   and ComB. ComA had a maximum vertical temperature difference of 1.01
   degrees C between H1.5m and H2.0m. Between H2.5m and H2.0m , the maximum
   vertical temperature difference for ComB was 1.64 degrees C. This study
   explored the changing patterns of under-tree vertical temperatures under
   different tree and surface cover combinations, conducive to clarifying
   the key elements affecting tree cooling performance. The results have
   implications for accurate thermal comfort assessments and provide a
   theoretical basis for fine-tuning the design of under-tree spaces.},

Title = {Non-invasive methods to quantify the carcass parameters of sheep:
   Interaction between thermal environment and residual feed intake},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {117},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The thermal environment is important in unit production because the
   perception of thermal stress can reduce fertility, and productive
   performance, therefore its management is necessary. The use of
   non-invasive methods, such as infrared thermography and real-time
   ultrasonography, are widely used to evaluate indicators in animal
   production, without the need to slaughter the animals. Thus, we aimed to
   assess the effect of the thermal environment on the physiological
   parameters and carcass characteristics of Dorper sheep with positive and
   negative residual feed intake (RFI) using infrared thermography and
   real-time ultrasonography techniques. Twenty uncastrated male Dorper
   sheep (17.8 +/- 2.4 kg) were confined for 40 days for RFI
   classification. Sheep were separated into positive RFI (n = 10) and
   negative RFI (n = 10). The experimental design was in randomized blocks,
   in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, with 2 thermal environments (full sun
   or shade) and two feed efficiency groups (positive RFI or negative RFI),
   with 5 replications. The sheep remained in confinement for 60 days. The
   animals were slaughtered at the end of the experiment and the carcasses
   dissected for tissue separation. Rectal temperature (RT) and respiratory
   rate (RR) were measured at two times (14:00 h and 18:00 h) for periods
   of 5 days. The RR was determined by indirect auscultation of heart
   sounds at the level of the laryngotracheal region. The RT was measured
   introduced a digital clinical thermometer into the animal's rectum.
   Surface temperature (ST) was obtained using a thermographic infrared
   camera, collecting the temperatures of the eyeball and skin surface in
   the regions of the head, ribs, rump, flank and shin. Sheep confined in
   full sun showed higher RR (P = 0.0001), ST ribs (P = 0.0020), ST rumb (P
   = 0.0055), ST flank (P = 0.0001) and heat tolerance coefficient (HTC) (P
   = 0.0010). For sheep confined in full sun, a strong correlation was
   observed between the RR and the mean ST (MST; r = 0.6826; P = 0.0236)
   and between the final loin eye area (LEAf) with the real LEA (LEAr) (r =
   0.9263; P = 0.0001) and slaughter body weight (SBW) (r = 0.7532; P =
   0.0325). For negative RFI sheep, a positive correlation was observed
   between the RR and the ST rump (r = 0.7343; P = 0.0025) and ST ribs (r =
   0.6560; P = 0.0178) and the MST (r = 0.7435; P = 0.0001), between the
   MST and the LEAr (r = 0.6837; P = 0.0025) and the final LEA (r = 0.6771;
   P = 0.0144), and between the final LEA and LEAr (r = 0.9942; P =
   0.0001), BW (r = 0.8415; P = 0.0277) and MST (r = 0.6771; P = 0.0045).
   Positive RFI sheep confined to shade showed a high correlation between
   final LEA and LEAr (r = 0.9372; P = 0.0001). The use of shading in
   confined Dorper sheep, regardless of the RFI classification, reduces the
   effects of heat stress on physiological parameters.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of ambient
   temperature and coriander seeds supplementation on growth performance
   and carcass characteristics of Koekoek chickens. In the experiment,
   chickens were exposed to two temperature rooms with a heated room of 32
   \& PLUSMN; 1.2 degrees C from 11:00 to16:00 h and a normal room
   temperature with an average maximum and minimum of 23.8 \& PLUSMN; 3
   degrees C and 16.6 \& PLUSMN; 1.6 degrees C, respectively, and a
   relative humidity between 34.5 \& PLUSMN; 4 and 44.8 \& PLUSMN; 3\%. The
   chickens were supplemented with 0, 5, and 10 g/kg of coriander seed
   powder. The results showed that the group of Koekoek chickens placed in
   a heated room had significantly lower (P < 0.05) feed intake and weight
   gain and significantly higher (P < 0.05) feed conversion ratio than the
   groups placed at normal room temperature. Water intake was 1.8\% higher
   in the groups placed in a heated room than those placed at normal room
   temperature. Supplementation with coriander seed powder enhanced growth
   performance and carcass traits. The carcass weight and breast percentage
   were higher (P < 0.05) in the groups that received 10 g/kg coriander
   seed powder. The growth performance of the Koekoek groups supplemented
   with 10 g/kg coriander seed powder in a heated room also improved
   significantly compared to groups in a heated room without
   supplementation. This suggests that the supplementation of coriander
   seed improves performance, and has a positive potential effect in
   alleviating the negative effects of heat stress on growth performance of
   chickens.},

Title = {Intensity of adaptations to heat stress in poultry farms: A behavioural
   analysis of farmers in Ondo state, Nigeria},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {115},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The detrimental consequences of heat stress due to high ambient
   temperatures, particularly in the poultry in-dustry, have led to the
   invention of several adaptation strategies. However, there is still
   limited information on the intensity of adaptations and the likely
   behavioural factors that influence farmers' decisions. Thus,
   under-standing the practical adaptation behaviours of poultry farmers
   would improve our knowledge of the funda-mental mechanisms for
   developing effective interventions. To fill this void, using a count
   data model, the study empirically examines the farmers' behavioural
   factors and the intensity of heat stress adaptation strategies' adoption
   among poultry farmers in Ondo State, Nigeria. The data were drawn from a
   survey of 150 poultry farmers using a multistage sampling procedure. The
   empirical results show that the majority of the farmers perceived an
   increase in temperature, frequently experienced heat stress, and
   believed that heat stress is induced by climate change. An average of
   six adaptation strategies were simultaneously adopted to mitigate heat
   stress in the area. The results of the count regression model reveal
   that farm-level factors such as permanent water sources, the quantity of
   feed, and bird stock density exert a significant effect on the intensity
   of adaptations. Climate-related factors such as access to climate
   information, training participation, perceived increases in temperature,
   attitudes toward climate change, and motives for adoption have a
   significant behavioural effect on the intensity of adaptations.
   Likewise, variables such as poultry farming experience, educational
   status, and access to credit are accounted for as socioeconomic
   behavioural factors that influence the intensity of adopting heat stress
   adaptation strategies in the area. This concludes that behavioural
   factors are crucial in addressing heat stress adaptations and assisting
   in improving environmental management, which would form a key variable
   in the policy interventions.},

   morphs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Temperature rules the lives of ectotherms. To perform basic biological
   functions, ectotherms must make behavioral adjustments to keep their
   body temperatures near a preferred temperature (Tpref). Many color
   polymorphic lizards are active thermoregulators and exhibit morph
   differences in traits related to thermoreg-ulation, such as color, body
   size, and microhabitat use. The Aegean wall lizard, Podarcis erhardii,
   is a heliothermic lizard with orange, white, and yellow color morphs
   that differ in size, behavior, and microhabitat use. Here, we tested
   whether P. erhardii color morphs from the same population from Naxos
   island, Greece, differ in Tpref. We hypothesized that orange morphs
   would prefer lower temperatures than white and yellow morphs because
   or-ange morphs are often found on cooler substrates and in microhabitats
   with more vegetation cover. We obtained Tpref for 95 individuals using
   laboratory thermal gradient experiments of wild-caught lizards and found
   that orange morphs do, indeed, prefer cooler temperatures. Average
   orange morph Tpref was 2.85 degrees C lower than average white and
   yellow morph Tpref. Our results add support to the idea that P. erhardii
   color morphs have multivariate alternative phenotypes and present the
   possibility that thermally heterogeneous environments play a role in the
   maintenance of color polymorphism in this species.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether young children's
   thermoregulation during heat exposure varies with age and body size. A
   total of 34 young children (aged 6 months-8 years)-18 boys and 16
   girl-s-participated in the study. They were divided into five groups
   according to age (<1 year, 1 year, 2-3 years, 4-5 years, and 8 years).
   The participants sat for 30 min in a 27 degrees C, 50\% rh room, then
   moved to a 35 degrees C, 70\% rh room and remained seated for at least
   30 min. They then returned to the first 27 degrees C room and remained
   stationary for 30 min. Rectal temperature (Tre) and skin temperature
   (Tsk) were continuously recorded, and the amount of whole-body sweat
   rate (SR) was measured. Local SR of the back and upper arm were
   collected with filter paper to calculate local sweating volume, and Na +
   concentration was measured later. The smaller the age, the
   signifi-cantly greater the increase in Tre. There was no significant
   difference in the amount of whole-body SR and the increase in Tsk during
   the heating among the five groups. Furthermore, there was no significant
   difference in whole-body SR per increase in Tre during heating between
   the five groups, but a significant difference was found in back local SR
   per increase in Tre with age. Difference in local SR between upper arm
   and back was observed at age 2 years and above, and difference in Na+
   concentrations in sweat was observed at age 8 years. The devel-opment of
   thermoregulatory responses with growth was observed. The results
   indicate that the thermoregulatory response is disadvantaged by immature
   mechanisms and small body size in younger children.},

Title = {Dry response and acclimated characteristics of people ascending the
   Tibetan Plateau},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Volume = {113},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Due to a long period of low humidity, exposure to the dry environment of
   the Tibetan Plateau can cause skin and respiratory diseases and threaten
   human health. To examine the characteristics of acclimatization response
   to humidity comfort in visitors to the Tibetan Plateau based on an
   examination of the targeted effect and mechanism of the dry environment.
   A scale corresponding to local dryness symptoms was proposed. Eight
   participants were selected to conduct a two-week plateau experiment and
   a one-week plain experiment under six humidity ratios, respectively, to
   explore the characteristics of dry response and acclimatization of
   people entering the plateau. The results indicate that duration has a
   significant effect on human dry response. On the sixth day after
   entering Tibet, the degree of dryness reached the maximum, and
   acclimatization to the plateau environment began on the 12th day. The
   sensitivity of different body parts to the change in a dry environment
   was different. When the indoor humidity ratio increased from 9.04 g/kg
   to 21.77 g/kg, the symptoms of dry skin were most significantly relieved
   by 0.5 units of scale. After de-acclimatization, the degree of dryness
   in the eyes was most significantly alleviated, reducing by nearly one
   scale. The analysis of human symptom indicators in a dry environment
   shows that subjective and physiological indices are influential and
   essential in measuring human comfort in a dry environment. This study
   extends our understanding of dry environment responses and cognition of
   human comfort and lays a solid foundation for humid built environments
   in the plateau.},

   dimorphic sepsid fly<i> Sepsis</i><i> thoracica</i>},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Climate is changing towards both higher average temperatures and more
   frequent and severe heat waves. Whereas numerous studies have
   investigated temperature effects on animal life histories, assessments
   of their immune function are limited. In the size-and colour-dimorphic
   black scavenger (or dung) fly Sepsis thoracica (Diptera: Sepsidae), we
   experimentally studied how developmental temperature and larval density
   influence phenoloxidase (PO) activity, a key enzyme in insect
   pigmentation, thermoregulation, and immunity. Flies from five
   latitudinal European populations were raised at three developmental
   temperatures (18, 24, 30 degrees C). PO ac-tivity increased with
   developmental temperature differently in the sexes and the two male
   morphs (black and orange), altering the sigmoid relationship between
   melanism, i.e. colouration and fly size. PO activity further positively
   correlated with larval rearing density, potentially because of higher
   risks of pathogen infection or greater developmental stress following
   stronger resource competition. Populations varied somewhat in PO
   ac-tivity, body size and colouration, however with no clear latitudinal
   pattern. Overall our results indicate that morph-and sex-specific PO
   activity, and thus likely immune function, in S. thoracica depends on
   temperature and larval density, modifying the underlying putative
   trade-off between immunity and body size. The strong dampening of the
   immune system of all morphs at cool temperatures suggests
   low-temperature stress in this warm-adapted species common in southern
   Europe. Our results also support the population density dependent
   prophylaxis hypothesis, which predicts higher investment in immunity
   when facing limited resource availability and increased pathogen
   infection probability.},

Abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is important in
   maintaining cellular oxygen homeostasis and cellular heat tolerance. To
   explore the role of HIF-1 alpha in the response to heat stress (HS) in
   dairy cows, 16 Chinese Holstein cows (milk yield: 32 \& PLUSMN; 4 kg/d,
   days in milk: 272 \& PLUSMN; 7 d, parity: 2-3) were used to collect
   coccygeal vein blood and milk samples when cows were under mild
   (temperature-humidity index = 77) and moderate HS (temperature-humidity
   index = 84), respectively. Compared to cows under mild HS, the
   respiratory rate (P < 0.01), rectal temperature (P < 0.01), and blood
   concentrations of heat shock protein (HSP)70 (P < 0.01) and HSP27 (P <
   0.01) were higher, but oxygen saturation (P = 0.02) and hemoglobin (P <
   0.01) were lower in cows under moderate HS. Blood HIF-1 alpha
   concentration was greater (P < 0.01) during moderate HS, indicating that
   HIF-1 alpha is involved in lactating cows' response to HS. To confirm
   these findings, we collected coccygeal vein blood and milk samples from
   59 dairy cows under moderate HS. The HIF-1 alpha levels were correlated
   with the levels of heat shock transcription factor (HSF) (r = 0.7857, P
   < 0.01), HSP70 (r = 0.4543, P < 0.01) and HSP27 (r = 0.8782, P < 0.01).
   A comparison of 15 cows with higher HIF-1 alpha (> 482 ng/L) and 15 cows
   with lower HIF-1 alpha levels (< 439 ng/L) showed that reactive
   oxidative species were higher (P = 0.02), but superoxide dismutase (P <
   0.01), total antioxidation capacity (P = 0.02) and glutathione
   peroxidase (P < 0.01) were lower in higher HIF-1 alpha cows. These
   results suggested that HIF-1 alpha may be indicative of the risk of
   oxidative stress in heat-stressed cows and may participate in the
   response of cows to HS by synergistically activating the expression of
   the HSP family with HSF.},

Title = {Analytical and numerical analysis of the dual-pulse lag heat transfer in
   a three-dimensional tissue subjected to a moving multi-point laser beam},

Abstract = {An extensive algorithm based on both analytical and numerical solution
   methodologies is proposed to obtain transient temperature distributions
   in a three-dimensional living tissue subjected to a moving single-point
   and multi-point laser beam by considering metabolic heat generation and
   blood perfusion rate. Here, the dual-phase lag/Pennes equation is
   analytically solved by using the method of Fourier series and the
   Laplace transform. The ability to model single-point or multi-point
   laser beams as an arbitrary function of place and time is a significant
   advantage of the proposed analytical approach, which can be used to
   solve similar heat transfer problems in other living tissues. Besides,
   the related heat conduction problem is numerically solved based on the
   finite element method. The effects of laser beam transitional speed,
   laser power, and the number of laser points on the temperature
   distribution within the skin tissue are investigated. Moreover, the
   temperature distribution predicted by the dual-phase lag model is
   compared with that of the Pennes model under different working
   conditions. For the studied cases, it is observed that the maximum
   tissue temperature decreased about 63\% by an increase of 6 mm/s in the
   speed of the laser beam. An increase in the laser power from 0.8 W/cm3
   to 1.2 W/cm3 results in a 28 degrees C increase in the maximum
   temperature of the skin tissue. It is observed that the maximum
   temperature predicted by the dual-phase lag model is always lower than
   that of the Pennes model and the temperature variations over time are
   sharper, while their results are entirely consistent over the simulation
   time. The obtained numerical results indicated that the dual-phase lag
   model is preferred in heating processes occurring at short intervals.
   Among the investigated parameters, the laser beam speed has the most
   considerable effect on the difference between the results of the Pennes
   and the dual-phase lag models.},

Abstract = {The current study deals with the mathematical modelling and analysis of
   the effects of thermoregulation on blood viscosity under magnetic and
   thermal radiation effects on a permeable, stretching blood capillary.
   The model comprises the governing equations of the resulting boundary
   layer problem, which is a set of nonlinear partial differential
   equations, and this is transformed into a coupled system of nonlinear
   differential equations using similarity transformation. The numerical
   solution of the problem is attained by the fourth-order Runge Kutta
   method with the shooting method. The current work examines the velocity
   and temperature profile of blood flow with the impact of varying
   temperature-dependent blood viscosity, involving the variation of
   several physical parameters such as magnetic field, radiation parameter,
   permeability parameter, Prandtl number, and surface temperature, as well
   as their physical interpretation. During certain therapies, the
   thermoregulation mechanism in humans causes a change in blood flow
   behaviour. Also, blood flow must be regulated during pathological
   conditions with the help of radiation, heat, or magnetic effects. It is
   found that, due to the varying viscosity parameter, the magnetic field
   effect inhibits heat transport in the body. It has also been found that
   increasing the permeability parameter enhances mass and heat transfer.
   The results of this paper could be important in analysing and regulating
   blood flow and body temperature during hypothermia and hyperthermia
   therapies.},

Title = {Influence of daily temperature maximums on the development and
   short-distance movement of the Asian citrus psyllid},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {110},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Temperature is a key factor in insect biology and ecology. Climate
   change is driving insect exposure to temperature extremes and
   understanding the effect of extreme temperatures on the biology of
   invasive agricultural pests will be key to predicting the effect of
   temperature increases. Here, we simulated diurnal cycles with different
   lengths of exposure times to maximum temperatures experienced in summer
   in different locations of California on the survivorship and development
   of the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama). ACP is
   the invasive vector of Huanglongbing disease (HLB), a lethal bacterial
   pathogen of citrus which is currently spreading in the Los Angeles,
   California basin. We also tested the effect of high or low humidity at
   high temperatures on ACP survival and development and the effect of high
   temperatures on short-distance dispersal. ACP were able to complete
   their life cycle in all temperature treatments (28-43 degrees C) except
   in daily cycles when 43 degrees C was maintained for 6 h. Temperature
   and exposure time significantly decreased adult emergence above 40
   degrees C. High temperatures significantly increased development time
   with longer development as exposure times to high temperatures
   increased. The interaction between low humidity and high temperature
   increased the number of emerging adults and decreased developmental
   times. ACP short-distance dispersal increased over time but was not
   affected by temperature. These results indicate that ACP are capable to
   develop in temperatures higher than previously reported, suggesting that
   increasing temperatures may reduce the invasive capacity of ACP in
   regions where maximum daily temperatures are increasing along with the
   duration of such temperatures throughout the day.},

Abstract = {Cryopreservation can keep the bioactivity of biological specimens in
   long-term storage, but it is hard to retain the structural integrity due
   to serious thermomechanical stress during cooling and warming
   procedures, especially for complex living organisms. Few studies have
   reported on the thermomechanical stress of biological specimens in a
   pre-freezing supercooled state, which is a widespread phenomenon in
   slow-rate freezing cryopreservation. Here, we develop a thermomechanical
   coupling model to study transient thermal and mechanical fields of
   supercooled biological specimens experiencing freezing procedures. The
   results show that cryoprotectant accumulation in insects causes
   pronounced supercooled phenomena with severe deformation and
   thermo-mechanical stress in the initial state of phase transition.
   However, the loss of freezable water induced that final deformation and
   stress decrease, which is beneficial to organism survival after
   freezing. This numerical method is proved to be a guideline for
   optimizing slow-rate freezing cryopreservation protocols efficiently and
   economi-cally. These results reveal survival mechanisms of insects with
   supercooled phenomena after freezing and assist researchers in exploring
   more valuable cryopreservation methods for biological specimens.},

Title = {Metabolic responses to increased temperatures in three semi-aquatic
   turtle species from the southeastern United States},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {109},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Physiological maintenance of ectotherms is largely dependent on
   temperature. Abrupt changes in environmental conditions can cause shifts
   in energy budgets, with higher temperatures requiring more energy be
   devoted to maintenance functions, making less energy available for other
   activities. As a group, freshwater turtles are of conservation concern;
   thus, it is important to understand their physiological responses to
   temperature shifts, particularly given current climate change
   predictions. We quantified metabolic rates (MR) for three species of
   semi-aquatic turtles that vary in their degree of terrestriality and
   propensity to aestivate: chicken turtles (Deir-ochelys reticularia),
   eastern mud turtles (Kinosternon subrubrum), and eastern musk turtles
   (Sternotherus odoratus). Metabolic trials were performed using a
   flow-through respirometer at three environmentally-relevant
   temper-atures: 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 35 degrees C. As
   expected, MRs of turtles were significantly and positively associated
   with increases in mass and temperature. Pairwise comparisons revealed
   that D. reticularia exhibited significantly higher oxygen consumption
   rates (VO2) relative to K. subrubrum , which had significantly higher
   VO2 than S. odoratus. The combination of higher metabolic rates, the
   tendency to terrestrially aestivate, and declining quantity of high
   quality thermal habitats may place some semi-aquatic turtles at a
   disadvantage when consid-ering future climate scenarios. Our findings,
   when combined with knowledge of other ecological traits, may be a useful
   tool for predicting relative sensitivities of turtle species to
   predicted climate change, particularly those species inhabiting seasonal
   wetlands.},

Title = {Cold cicadas and hot rocks: Thermal responses and thermoregulation in
   some New Zealand cicadas (Insecta: Hemiptera: Cicadidae: Cicadettinae:
   Cicadettini)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {107},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We determine the thermal responses for 11 species from four genera of
   New Zealand cicadas. Thermal responses are remarkably similar regardless
   of environment or elevation inhabited by the species. The thermal
   responses of New Zealand cicadas do not show the same variability as
   cicada species in similarly diverse environments in Africa, Australia,
   Europe, North America, and South America nor the correlation to
   elevation as seen in some North American cicadas. Behavioral
   thermoregulation appears to be the mechanism permitting the distribution
   of species into specific habitats so that diverging thermal adaptation
   was not necessary as speciation occurred. The first example of a cicada
   using conductive heat transfer to thermoregulate is provided. These data
   show an evolutionary divergence from what otherwise have been convergent
   thermal adaptation patterns in a variety of cicadas separated by large
   geographic distances and species phylogeny.},

Title = {Effects of acute heat stress on liver damage, apoptosis and inflammation
   of pikeperch (<i>Sander lucioperca</i>)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {106},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) is a sub-cold water fish species with high
   aquaculture potential. Its culture is seriously affected by increasing
   summer temperatures in recent years. Aim to investigate the effects of
   heat stress on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and the immune response in
   pikeperch. the fish were heat stressed at 30 degrees C, 32 degrees C and
   34 degrees C for 2h respectively, followed by a 48h recovery period. The
   results showed that as temperature increased, the contents of
   malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the liver
   increased significantly. Meanwhile, acute heat stress results in
   progressive deleterious alterations in liver tissue, especially vascular
   rupture, blood infiltration, and severe vacuolation at 34 degrees C.
   TUNEL staining revealed that the apoptosis level increased significantly
   with the rising temperature. Acute heat stress significantly induced the
   mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes, including tumor suppressor
   (p53), B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2), bcl-2associated X (bax), apoptotic
   protease activating factor-1 (apaf-1), cysteinyl aspartate specific
   proteinase (caspase-3 and caspase-9), and the expression of p53 was also
   positively correlated with bax expression and the bax/ bcl-2 ratio.
   Additionally, caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity increased significantly
   at 34 degrees C compared with the control group (23 degrees C). Innate
   immune genes, including tumor necrosis factor (tnf-alpha), interleukins
   (il-7, il-8, il-10 and il-1 beta), complement 3 (c3) were activated
   under acute heat stress, and H2O2 content was positively correlated with
   the expressions of tnf-alpha and il-1 beta. After the temperature
   reached again 23 degrees C, most measured indexes in heat-stressed
   groups didn't return to stress-free levels, and liver tissue also didn't
   return to its normal state in the histopathology. It was found that
   p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was triggered in pikeperch
   under acute heat stress, and there may be a vicious cycle between
   oxidative stress and inflammation. In summary, the present study is
   helpful to elucidate how acute heat stress mediates liver injury of
   pikeperch through mitochondrial pathway, inflammation and oxidative
   stress.},

Title = {Trends and developments in thermal tolerance: A scientometric research
   study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {106},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Climate action was among one of the main targets for the United Nation
   Sustainable Development Goals (i.e. UN SDG: 13), which is to ``take
   urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts{''}. The United
   Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is also
   concurred to improve climate change's mitigation and adaptation
   strategies along with the SDG's goals. Thermal tolerance has been
   proposed as one of the possible adaptation strategies for animals
   affected by anthropogenic effects and excess heat from climate change.
   However, no scientometrics analysis of thermal tolerance research has
   been conducted to date. As a result, the goal of this study was to
   gather information from the literature to determine the current state of
   thermal tolerance, development trends, and current research. Researchers
   will be able to better understand the trends and development of the
   thematic research area of thermal tolerance by using scientometric
   analysis to generate data on thermal tolerance. For frequency,
   co-occurrence, co-citation, clustering, and burst analysis, CiteSpace
   software was used. The scientometric review of thermal tolerance studies
   from 1970 to 2021 (5243 studies) reveals significant increases in the
   size of the literature, the frequency of citations, and the hotspots
   investigated. Susan Lindquist and the Journal of Thermal Biology are the
   most influential authors and journals, respectively. The most common
   clusters related to the thematic area of thermal tolerance are oxygen
   consumption and heat shock protein, with climate change and temperature
   being one of the most popular keywords. We concluded that, along with
   the thriving field and climate change issues, thermal tolerance is
   becoming one of the future research interests. In addition, knowing the
   current trends and developments of thermal tolerance in aquatic species
   is important for various stakeholders.},

Title = {Evaluating the role of dietary plant extracts to allow adaptation to
   thermal stress in a cold stream ornamental fish, <i>Botia rostrata</i>
   (Gunther, 1868)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Increases in ambient temperature affect the biochemical status of fish,
   and dietary supplementation with bioactive phytoconstituents may promote
   resilience against environmental stress. This study evaluated the impact
   of three plant extracts on the biochemical status of a cold stream fish
   Botia rostrata (Gunther, 1868) under high temperatures. After 1 month
   dietary supplementation separately with Mucuna pruriens methanol extract
   (0.25 g/kg feed), Tribulus terrestris ethanol extract (0.5 g/kg feed)
   and Basella alba ethanol extract (1.0 g/kg feed), juvenile fish (Wt. 4.3
   +/- 0.5g) were exposed to different sublethal heat stress {[}28 +/- 0.5
   degrees C (T1), 32 +/- 0.5 degrees C (T2), 36 +/- 0.5 degrees C (T3)].
   Control fish were fed a diet without any plant extract and maintained at
   24 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Serum and muscle tissues were collected to measure
   different biochemical parameters, muscle metabolic enzymes and molecular
   chaperons before and after heat stress. Before stress, the group fed the
   Mucuna diet showed significant (P < 0.05) increases in serum glucose
   {[}+10.92\%], protein {[}+18.93\%], muscle heat shock protein (HSP) 90
   {[}+8.6\%] compared to the control group. No significant change (P >
   0.05) of stress parameters was observed between control, Tribulus and
   Basella fed fish. The control group exposed to T3 showed significant
   differences (P < 0.05) in protein {[}-26.19\%], lactate dehydrogenase
   {[}+93.69\%], fructose 1,6 bisphosphate {[}-35.19\%], phosphorylase `a'
   {[}+35.72\%], HSP60 {[}+69.54\%], HSP70 {[}+84.85\%], HSP90
   {[}+92.07\%], heat shock factor (HSF) 1 {[}+88.48\%] suggesting
   susceptibility of Botia to this temperature. Among the three plant
   extracts, Mucuna methanol extract was effective to enhance resistance
   against temperature-induced biochemical alterations. After exposure to
   T3, only the fish fed Mucuna diet showed no mortality. Fish fed Mucuna
   diet exposed to 36 +/- 0.5 degrees C showed significantly higher (P <
   0.05) glucose {[}+42.82\%], protein {[}+11.98\%], citrate synthase
   {[}+59.81\%], phosphorylase `a' {[}+14.96\%], Glucose 6 phosphate
   dehydrogenase {[}+60.87\%], HSP60 {[}+34.13\%], HSP70 {[}+41.42\%],
   HSP90 {[}+65.91\%], HSF1 {[}+61.32\%] compared to those in Mucuna fed
   fish maintained at 24 +/- 0.5 degrees C. These results highlight
   temperature-induced biochemical alterations in Botia and point towards
   the potential use of Mucuna in overcoming such adverse high thermal
   stress.},

Abstract = {Honeybees have a limited capacity to control their body temperature when
   exposed to thermal changes in the atmosphere. Environmental changes,
   such as thermal climate change, have an adverse effect on honeybee
   survival. Insects can be pre-heat-treated (rapid heat hardening) with a
   mild heat stressor to induce Hsp gene expression and protect them from
   future stresses. Sixty accepted mother queen (MQ) larvae at the age of 7
   days were selected and divided into two incubation treatment groups (n =
   30). The control group (non-heat-treated mother queens, nH-T MQ) was
   maintained at 34.5 degrees C for 15 min and 70\% relative humidity (RH),
   and the preheat-treated (pre-heat-treated mother queens, pH-T MQ) group
   was subjected to 41 degrees C for 15 min and 70\% RH. To evaluate the
   effect of larval pre-heat-treatment on thermotolerance acquisition of
   daughter workers, about 500 workers were collected from brood combs of
   each treatment group. The worker bees in their cages were incubated in
   digital-controlled thermo-incubators for 1 h under each of the following
   temperatures: 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 degrees C. The expression of
   Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, HSC70-3, HSC70-4, HSC70-5, Hsp83, and Hsp90 genes
   in both head and thorax were evaluated by relative quantitative
   real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR). In general, the pH-T MQ workers exhibited a
   higher ability to tolerate temperature than nH-T MQ workers under
   extreme conditions. Furthermore, we reported for the first time that
   pre-heat treatment of the mother queen's larvae alters the basal and
   dynamic expression of heat shock proteins (Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, and
   Hsp90) and heat shock factor (HSF) during thermoneutral conditions and
   during heat stress of daughter workers, probably indicating a
   substantial improvement of honeybees' thermotolerance acquisition in
   arid and semi-arid regions, and improvement of honeybee longevity and
   management strategies.},

Abstract = {Although cool- and warm-seeking behaviors for behavioral
   thermoregulation are considered to be appetitive/approach and
   aversive/avoidance behaviors, the neuronal circuits mediating such
   behaviors remain to be elucidated. A growing body of evidence suggests
   that the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) is a key brain region in
   a neuronal circuit that mediates appetitive/approach and
   aversive/avoidance behaviors. In this study, to elucidate the neuronal
   circuits mediating behavioral thermoregulatory responses, we examined
   whether neuronal pathways from the PVT to the nucleus accumbens (NAc),
   bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BLAST), and central nucleus of the
   amygdala (CeA), which are brain regions implicated in mediating
   appetitive/approach and aversive/avoidance behaviors, are activated
   during exposure to hot (38 degrees C) and cold (8 degrees C)
   environments using c-Fos immunostaining and retrograde tracing. Our
   results showed activation of neuronal pathways from the PVT to the NAc,
   BNST, and CeA during exposure to hot and cold environments, suggesting
   that activation of these pathways may be involved in avoidance behaviors
   from hot and cold environments for behavioral thermoregulation.},

Title = {Sex-specific thermal tolerance limits in the ditch shrimp <i>Palaemon
   varians</i>: Eco-evolutionary implications under a warming ocean},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {103},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As global temperatures continue to rise due to global change, marine
   heatwaves are also becoming more frequent and intense, impacting marine
   biodiversity patterns worldwide. Organisms inhabiting shallow water
   environments, such as the commercially relevant ditch shrimp Palaemon
   varians, are expected to be the most affected by rising temperatures.
   Thus, addressing species' thermal ecology and climate extinction-risk is
   crucial to foster climate-smart conservation strategies for shallow
   water ecosystems. Here, we estimated sex-specific upper thermal
   tolerance limits for P. varians via the Critical Thermal Maximum method
   (CTmax), using loss of equilibrium as endpoint. We further calculated
   thermal safety margins for males and females and tested for correlations
   between upper thermal limits and shrimps' body size. To determine
   sex-biased variation in P. varians' traits (CTmax, weight and length),
   we compared trait variation between females and males through the
   coefficient of variation ratio (InCVR). Females displayed an average
   CTmax value 1.8\% lower than males (CTmax(females) = 37.0 degrees C vs
   CTmax(males) = 37.7 degrees C). This finding may be related to the
   larger body size exhibited by females (156\% heavier and 39\% larger
   than males), as both length and weight had a significant effect on
   CTmax. The high energetic investment of females in offspring may also
   contribute to the differences recorded in thermal tolerance. Overall,
   organisms with a smaller body-size displayed a greater tolerance to
   elevated temperature, thus suggesting that smaller individuals may be
   positively selected in warmer environments. This selection may result in
   a reduction of size-at-maturity and shifts in sex ratio, given the
   sexual dimorphism in body size of shrimps. The thermal safety margin of
   P. varians was narrow (similar to 2.2 degrees C for males and similar to
   1.5 degrees C for females), revealing the vulnerability of this species
   to ocean warming and heatwaves.},

Title = {Quantitative assessment of Bell's palsy-related facial thermal asymmetry
   using infrared thermography: A preliminary study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {100},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The temperature distribution of normal human skin is symmetrical. Facial
   paralysis generally changes this thermal symmetry. The aim of this study
   is to analyze facial thermal asymmetry during the early onset of Bell's
   palsy, and to assess the feasibility of the diagnosis of early-onset
   Bell's palsy using infrared thermography (IRT). Fifteen subjects with
   Bell's palsy and 15 healthy volunteers were considered in this study.
   The infrared thermal images of the front, left, and right sides of all
   the subjects were collected and analyzed. Each group of facial
   thermograms was divided into 16 symmetrical regions of interest (ROIs)
   with respect to the left and right sides. Three different temperature
   difference calculation methods were used to express the degree of
   thermal symmetry between the left-and right-side ROIs, namely, the mean
   temperature difference (Delta T-roi), maximum temperature difference
   (Delta T-max), and minimum temperature difference (Delta T-min). Among
   the facial ROIs, there were significant differences in the thermal
   symmetries of the frontal region, medial canthus region, and
   infraorbital region between subjects with and without Bell's palsy (p <
   0.05). Based on the results, Delta T-roi was more effective than the
   other two methods for the diagnosis of early-onset Bell's palsy. The
   area under the ROC curve (AUC) of Delta T-roi in the infraorbital region
   was 0.818; and the sensitivity and specificity were 0.867 and 0.800,
   respectively. Subjects with early-onset Bell's palsy exhibited thermal
   asymmetry on the left and right sides of their faces. The diagnosis of
   early-onset Bell's palsy using IRT is therefore necessary. Nevertheless,
   more effective thermal symmetry analysis methods will be investigated
   further in future research.},

Title = {The heat shock response shows plasticity in embryonic lake whitefish
   (<i>Coregonus clupeaformis</i>) exposed to repeated thermal stress},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {100},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We examined the impact of repeated thermal stress on the heat shock
   response (HSR) of thermally sensitive lake whitefish (Coregonus
   clupeaformis) embryos. Our treatments were designed to mimic temperature
   fluctuations in the vicinity of industrial thermal effluents. Embryos
   were either maintained at control temperatures (3 degrees C) or exposed
   to a repeated thermal stress (TS) of 3 or 6 degrees C above control
   temperature every 3 or 6 days throughout embryonic development. At 82
   days post-fertilisation, repeated TS treatments were stopped and embryos
   received either a high level TS of 12, 15, or 18 degrees C above ambient
   temperature for 1 or 4 h, or no additional TS. These treatments were
   carried out after a 6 h recovery from the last repeated TS. Embryos in
   the no repeated TS group responded, as expected, with increases in hsp70
   mRNA in response to 12, 15 and 18 degrees C high-level TS. However,
   exposure to repeated TS of 3 or 6 C every 6 days also resulted in a
   significant upregulation of hsp70 mRNA relative to the controls.
   Importantly, these repeated TS events and the associated elevations in
   hsp70 attenuated the upregulation of hsp70 in response to a 1 h,
   high-level TS of 12 degrees C above ambient, but not to either longer (4
   h) or higher (15 or 18 degrees C) TS events. Conversely, hsp90 alpha
   mRNA levels were not consistently elevated in the no repeated TS groups
   exposed to high-level TS. In some instances, hsp90 alpha levels appeared
   to decrease in embryos exposed to repeated TS followed by a high-level
   TS. The observed attenuation of the HSR in lake whitefish embryos
   demonstrates that embryos of this species have plasticity in their HSR
   and repeated TS may protect against high-level TS, but the response
   differs based on repeated TS treatment, high-level TS temperature and
   duration, and the gene of interest.},

Title = {The joint effect of micro- and macro-climate on the thermoregulation and

Abstract = {The effect of the macro- and micmclimate on small mammal
   thermoregulation in the past has been studied independently instead of
   investigating the dual effect of both the components. This study
   addresses this dearth in knowledge by exploring the dual effect of both
   micro- and macro-climate on the thermoregulatory responses of two
   subterranean rodent species belonging to the family Bathyergidae, namely
   the more arid dwelling Mahali mole-rat (Cryptomys hottentotus mahali)
   and less arid dwelling Highveld mole-rat (C. h. pretoriae). Open flow
   through respirometry was used to quantify resting metabolic rates (RMR),
   evaporative water loss (EWL), core body temperature (Tb), the ratio
   between the evaporative heat loss and metabolic heat production
   (EHL/MHP: evaporative cooling capacity) and conductance (C-dry) over a
   range of increasing ambient temperatures (T-a; 20-42 degrees C).
   Furthermore, RMR, EWL, T-b, EHL/MHP and C-dry were measured at the
   mole-rat's thermal maxima (43 degrees C). At cooler temperatures, the
   arid-dwelling C. h. mahali possesses a broader thermoneutral zone
   (similar to 5 degrees C; 27.2-32.1 degrees C), while C. h. pretoriae
   possess a single thermoneutral point (33.6 degrees C). This is in
   response to the greater selection pressure to conserve energy in the
   more arid regions inhabited by C. h. mahali. Contrastingly, at hotter
   temperatures, there were no significant thermoregulatory differences in
   EWL, EHL/MHP or C-dry responses between the two sub-species, as expected
   due to the limitations bestowed by the buffered microclimates (burrow
   systems). Thus, neither macro-climate, nor micro-climate singularly
   moulds the thermoregulatory adaptations, but rather, it appears to be a
   combined effect from both climates. Other small endotherms may share
   this dual response, and therefore, it is crucial to incorporate the
   effect of both macro- and microclimates into future climate models when
   determining the ecological capabilities and persistence of a species.},

Title = {Effects of warming rates on physiological and molecular components of
   response to CTMax heat stress in the Antarctic fish <i>Harpagifer
   antarcticus</i>},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Volume = {99},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Maximum and minimum Critical thermal limits (CTMax and CTMin) have been
   studied extensively to assess thermal tolerance in ectotherms by means
   of ramping assays. Notothenioid fish have been proposed as particularly
   sensitive to temperature increases related to global climate change.
   However, there are large gaps in our understanding of the thermal
   responses of these extreme cold-adapted fish in assays with heating
   rates. We evaluated the effects of two commonly used heating rates (0.3
   and 1 degrees C/min) on the cellular stress responses in the intertidal
   Antarctic fish Harpagifer antarcticus immediately after CTMax was
   reached, and at 2 and 4 h of recovery time in ambient water. We compared
   CTMax values, the relative transcript expression of genes relvant to
   heat shock response (Hsc70, Hsp70, Grp78), hypoxia (Hif1-alpha, LDHa,
   GR), ubiquitination (Ube2), and apoptosis (SMAC/DIABLO), and five plasma
   parameters - glucose, lactate, total protein, osmolality and cortisol.
   CTMax values between the two heating rates are not significantly
   different, and both rates elicited a similar stress response at
   molecular and physiological levels. We found a lack of up-regulated
   response of heat shock proteins, consistent with other Antarctic
   notothenioids. The general transcriptional pattern trended to
   downregulation, which was more evident in the slower 0.3 degrees C/min
   rate, and instances of upregulation were mainly related to
   ubiquitination. The faster 1 degrees C/min rate, rarely used for
   Antarctic fish, can be suitable for studying cold-adapted stenothermic
   fish without overestimating thermal tolerance or inducing damage from
   longer heat exposure.},

   preferences of Tropidurus catalanensis to investigate if they match or
   diverge as demonstration respectively of suitability or poor-quality of
   the thermal environment. As T. catalanensis is subjected to variable
   thermal conditions along its distribution and may be jeopardized by the
   climate change, we measured its thermal preferences after exposure to
   milder (17 degrees C-27 degrees C) and warmer (22 degrees C-32 degrees
   C) thermal conditions to evaluate acclimatory responses and tolerances
   and vulnerabilities to warming. Field body temperatures tended to be
   similar to minimum preferred body temperatures, and microhabitat and
   body temperatures in the field were cooler in the remaining comparisons
   with thermal preferences {[}preferred (T-pref), set-point range (T-set),
   minimum preferred (T-pref\_min) and maximum preferred (T-pref\_max) body
   temperatures], suggesting there was a constraint to warming up in
   nature. The minimum preferred body temperatures may be a threshold
   separating proper functioning from markedly noxious impacts due to
   progressive impairment by the cooling. Difficulties to warm and keep
   suitable body temperatures may jeopardize overall ecophysiological and
   behavioral processes with implications for maintenance, fitness, and
   survival. The constraints to warm may impact T. catalanensis differently
   depending on its body size and its properties of heat conservation
   (thermal inertia). Smaller and larger T. catalanensis may respectively
   cool down easier and have difficulties to warm up, being jeopardized by
   the constraints due to the cold. The warmer preferred body temperatures
   coupled with the cooler microhabitats and bodies in nature complicate to
   anticipate how individuals will respond to climate change, but the
   acclimation to the warmer temperatures led six of them to death,
   suggesting they had limited tolerance to heat and would be vulnerable to
   global warming.},

Abstract = {The present study was aimed to assess the effect of temperatures on egg
   incubation, growth, standard metabolic rate (SMR), and thermal tolerance
   of a near threatened Himalayan hill stream chocolate mahseer
   (Neolissochilus hexagonolepis). For the hatching study, eggs were
   incubated in four temperatures (17, 20, 23, and 26 degrees C). The total
   hatching and free-swimming larvae percentage were higher at 23 degrees C
   (p < 0.05). Experiment I (for validation of the CTmax method) was
   carried out by incubating eggs at 17 degrees C and 23 degrees C. The
   CTmax was estimated in response to different warming rates (1-18 degrees
   C h(-1)), acclimation temperatures (17 and 23 degrees C), and the age of
   fishes (8, 15, 35 dph). The results suggested that a warming rate of 18
   degrees C h(-1) could be used for the thermal tolerance study of
   yolk-sac larvae (8 dph) and 35 dph larvae, but for free-swimming larvae
   (15 dph) up to 3 degrees C h(-1) is suitable. Experiment II (for growth,
   SMR and thermal tolerance) was carried by acclimatizing 15 dph larvae in
   five temperatures (15, 19, 23, 27, and 31 degrees C) for 60 days. The
   mean growth rate increased with the increase in temperature from 15
   degrees C to 27 degrees C (1.30-3.58\% day(-1)) and decreased at 31
   degrees C. The mean SMR of the chocolate mahseer in the above
   acclimation temperatures was ranged from 1.14 +/- 0.36 to 2.81 +/- 0.15
   mu gO(2)h(-1)mg(-1) and were significantly different (p < 0.01). The
   Q(10) with the SMR of the fish suggested the preferred temperature
   ranged between 23 and 27 degrees C, and the optimum temperature for
   growth (ToptG) was estimated to be 25 degrees C. Chocolate mahseer is an
   eurythermal species which is advantageous for aquaculture practices due
   to its wide thermal tolerance zone (411.68 degrees C-2 in 15 to 31
   degrees C acclimation temperature range) and high ARR values (0.49 -
   0.54).},

Title = {Effects of mancozeb on heat Shock protein 70 (HSP70) and its
   relationship with the thermal physiology of<i> Physalaemus</i><i>
   henselii</i> (Peters, 1872) tadpoles (Anura: Leptodactylidae)},

Abstract = {Negative impacts on amphibians have been reported due to contamination
   by agrochemicals. However, until now, no study has tested the effect of
   the fungicide mancozeb (MZ) on thermal tolerance and its relationship
   with the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). MZ is the
   best-selling broad-spectrum fungicide in the world, which negatively
   affects non-target organisms. Here, we tested for the first time the
   effects of MZ on critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and its relationship
   to the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in tadpoles of
   Physalameus henselii, a colder-adapted species in southernmost of the
   Neotropical region. A sublethal concentration of 2 mg/L was used. We
   found that the CTmax of the MZ-treated group was lower than that of the
   control group. In addition, there was an increase in HSP70 expression in
   tadpoles exposed to MZ and in tadpoles that underwent heat treatment.
   However, tadpoles subjected to MZ and heat treatment showed no induced
   HSP70 protein expression. Our results demonstrated that sublethal doses
   of the fungicide MZ negatively affected the thermal physiology and heat
   shock protein expression in tadpoles of P. henselii by inducing an
   increase in HSP70 concentration and by reducing the critical CTmax
   supported by tadpoles. It is important to understand the relationship
   between environmental contamination and physiological thermal limits in
   our current scenario of high rates of habitat conversion associated with
   unrestricted use of agrochemicals, as well as the challenging
   environmental changes induced by global warming.},

Title = {Av-UCP single nucleotide polymorphism affects heat production during
   cold exposure in chicks},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {98},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective: Uncoupling protein one (UCP1) is involved in thermogenesis,
   especially in non-shivering heat production. In chickens, a single
   nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the av-UCP (avian UCP) gene has been
   reported to be associated with body weight gain and increased abdominal
   fat. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between
   the av-UCP gene SNP and heat production in chicks.
   Methods: C/C and T/T male chicks (Rhode Island Red) of av-UCP gene SNP
   (g. 1270, C > T) were exposed to a low temperature environment (16
   degrees C for 15 min) and their physiological responses were compared.
   Results: After cold exposure, mean rectal temperatures of C/C chicks
   were higher than those of T/T chicks. In pectoral muscle, genes
   expression of av-UCP and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 were higher in
   C/C chicks than T/T chicks. Hypothalamic expression levels of
   thyrotropin-releasing hormone and proopiomelanocortin genes were higher
   in C/C chicks than T/T chicks. Expression of hypothalamic
   corticotropin-releasing hormone, arginine vasotocin, brain-derived
   neurotrophic factor and neuropeptide Y genes did not differ between C/C
   and T/T chicks. In addition, plasma free fatty acid levels in C/C chicks
   were lower than those of T/T chicks.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that the av-UCP gene SNP affects
   non-shivering heat production via the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis
   and fatty acid metabolism in the chicken.},

   monodon post larvae: A mesocosm study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Global climate change induced warming has profound repercussion on
   physiological performances of marine animals. The Indian Sundarban is
   one of the best nursery grounds for various shrimp populations which
   need estuarine realm to complete their bipartite life cycle. From last
   couple of decades, a clear indication of temperature escalation has been
   identified in Sundarban. In the present study, we have assessed the
   physiological energetics of Penaeus monodon post larvae from Indian
   Sundarban under different temperatures, 28 ?C (annual average habitat
   temperature) and elevated temperatures 30 ?C, 32 ?C, 34 ?C in a month
   long mesocosm experiment. Significant alterations were observed in
   growth performances as well as physiological energetics. The length,
   weight, survival percentages, ingestion rates were reduced, howbeit
   respiration and ammonia excretion rate had been increased in elevated
   temperature treatments culminating in a negative Scope for Growth.
   PERMANOVA results showed a significant (p < 0.05) variation in different
   physiological performances of shrimp post larvae both in different
   temperature treatments and days of exposure. The present results clearly
   highlighted the detrimental effect of elevated temperature on
   physiological energetics of shrimp larvae that might potentially reduce
   shrimp population and affect the coastal fishery.},

Title = {The use of infrared thermal imaging in tonometry with a Scheimpflug
   camera},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {96},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Infrared thermal imaging is currently used in almost every field of
   medicine. This paper presents the novel use of thermography in
   ophthalmology - using a thermal camera to assess correct intraocular
   pressure measurement depending on the position of the patient?s head
   during non-contact tonometry. For the analysed group of 10 healthy
   subjects, thermographic images of the face were recorded before and
   after intraocular pressure testing. Pressure was tested with a
   non-contact tonometer with a Scheimpflug camera. For the acquired 20: 2D
   images (thermograms), an analysis of the characteristic areas of the
   face determined temperature changes of the patient?s face in contact
   with the tonometer frame. Analysis and processing of the acquired
   thermograms was carried out in MATLAB? with the Image Processing
   Toolbox. The results clearly showed a decrease in the patient?s face
   temperature where the face was in contact with tonometer supports.
   Temperature changes in the patient?s face provide valuable information
   about the correct position of their head in the device, which directly
   translates into measurement quality. Therefore, the analysis of changes
   in the patient?s face temperature both before and after the examination
   can be a tool for assessing correct patient positioning in the tonometer
   supports.},

Title = {Scrotal thermoregulation and sequential sperm abnormalities in buffalo
   bulls <i>(Bubalus bubalis)</i> under short-term heat stress},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Heat stress reduces the reproductive capacity of bulls raised in
   tropical climate. However, the reestablishment of scrotal
   thermoregulation and the dynamics of sperm defects emergence after
   stress are not completely known in buffaloes. Thus, the study aimed to
   evaluate the effect of short-term heat stress over scrotal
   thermoregulation and sperm attributes, relating them to spermatogenesis
   stages. Five buffalo bulls went through scrotal insulation during 48 h
   (from day 0 to day 2). Semen samples were collected every 7 days (from
   day 7 to day 49) and analyzed about the progressive motility, viability,
   and sperm morphology. Heat stress significantly destabilized scrotal
   thermoregulation (P < 0.001). Scrotal temperature was from 4.2 to 6.3
   degrees C lower than the core body temperature, except on insulation
   days (P < 0.001), and returned to the basal condition five days after
   the removal of the stressing stimulus. More significant deleterious
   effects were observed in sperm morphology than in cell concentration,
   motility, and viability. The chronology of morphologic defects
   expression demonstrated tail defects (days 7-14), cytoplasmic droplets
   (days 14-28), and head defects (day 28), returning to pre-insulation
   condition 35 days after the thermal challenge. Thus, hyperthermia harmed
   more intensely spermatozoa in epididymal transit, elongated spermatids,
   and secondary spermatocytes. It is concluded that water buffalo bulls
   present a peculiar manifestation of sperm morphology after short-term
   stress, indicating an important difference related to the bovine
   species. Therefore, during the andrological evaluation of buffalo bulls,
   it is necessary to avoid the allometric extrapolation between these
   species.},

Title = {Heat stroke-related deaths in India: An analysis of natural causes of
   deaths, associated with the regional heatwave},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {95},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Soaring temperatures cause deaths in large numbers in various parts of
   India. The number of deaths vary with region and are influenced by the
   demographics and socioeconomic characteristics of the region. This study
   tried to estimate the number of deaths associated with exposure to heat
   in the different states of India. Secondary data was used, which was
   collected from the website data.gov.in , an Open Government Data (OGD)
   Platform of the Indian government. Descriptive statistics were applied
   using Microsoft Excel-10. It was found that there 3014 men died from
   heat-related causes in 2001-05, which increased to 5157 in the period
   2011-15. For women the number of deaths in the corresponding periods
   were 849 and 1254 respectively. Deaths caused by heatwaves were found to
   be higher than those resulting from avalanches, exposure to cold,
   cyclone, tornado, starvation due to natural calamity, earthquake,
   epidemic, flood, landslide, torrential rain and forest fire. The study
   revealed that there are regional variations in the number deaths due to
   heatstroke. From the perspective of disaster preparedness, it is
   important to note that deaths from heat strokes occur every year. With
   rising temperatures, the numbers are likely to increase. The findings of
   the study highlight this concern. Therefore, there is a need for
   targeted region-specific interventions for reducing the number of deaths
   due to heatwaves.},

Title = {Are southern African solitary mole-rats homeothermic or heterothermic
   under natural field conditions?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {95},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Abandoning of a stable body temperature (T-b), a phenomenon known as
   hetemthermy, is an adaptation to cope mainly with a lack of food and
   water, especially in species inhabiting daily or seasonally variable
   environments. There is increasing evidence that African mammals avoid
   adverse conditions by heterothermy and eventually by entering torpor.
   Members of subterranean rodent family, the African mole-rats
   (Bathyergidae), are suitable candidates to study both phenomena, because
   of the diversity of their strategies in respect of maintaining stable
   T-b ranging from homeothermic species to a mammal with the most labile
   T-b, the naked mole-rat. Currently, there are field data on daily and
   seasonal T-b in one social species only and such information are lacking
   for any solitary mole-rat. In our study, we recorded yearly T-b in two
   solitary bathyergids, the Cape mole-rat Georychus capensis and the Cape
   dune mole-rat Bathyergus suillus from South Africa using
   intraperitoneally implanted dataloggers. Since this region is
   characterised by changing ecological characteristics, we expected either
   decreases of T-b within 24 h indicating daily torpor and/or longer-term
   decreases of T-b, which would indicate multiday torpor. Although we
   found seasonally phase shifted low amplitude daily T-b cycles, we did
   not find any remarkable and regular daily and/or seasonal T-b
   deviations, likely showing an absence of torpor in both species. Due to
   absence of this energy saving mechanism, we may speculate that both
   species could be vulnerable to ongoing global climatic change.},

Title = {The effect of cold and heat waves on mortality in Urmia a cold region in
   the North West of Iran},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {94},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Few studies have investigated the different extreme temperature effects
   (heat-cold) of one geographical location at the same time in Iran. This
   study was conducted to assess the impact of heat and cold waves on
   mortality in Urmia city, which has a cold and mountainous climate.
   Distributed Lag Non-linear Models combined with a quasi-Poisson
   regression were used to assess the impact of heat (HW) and cold waves
   (CW) on mortality in subgroups, controlled for potential confounders
   such as long-term trend of daily mortality, day of week effect,
   holidays, mean temperature, humidity, wind speed and air pollutants. The
   heat/cold effect was divided into two general categories A-main effect
   (the effect caused by temperature), B-added effect (the effect caused by
   persistence of extreme temperature). Results show that there was no
   relation between HW and respiratory and cardiovascular death, but in
   main effects, HW(H1) significantly increased, the risk of Non-Accidental
   Death (NAD) in lag 0 (Cumulative Excess Risk (CER) (NAD) = 31(CI;
   4-65)). Also in added effects, HW had a significant effect on NAD (CER
   (H1; NAD; lag;0-2) = 31(CI; 5, 51), CER (H2; NAD; lag;0-2) = 26(CI; 6,
   48)). There was no relation between CW and respiratory death and
   cardiovascular death, but in added effects, CW((C1)) significantly
   decreased, the risk of non-accidental death in initial lags (CER (C1;
   NAD; lag;0-2) = 19 (CI; 35, 2)). It seems that high temperatures and
   heat waves increase the risk of non-accidental mortality in northwest of
   Iran.},

Abstract = {With expanding human populations, the food sector has faced constant
   pressure to sustainably expand and meet global production demands. In
   aquaculture this frequently manifests in an animal welfare crisis, with
   fish increasingly farmed under high production, high stress conditions.
   These intense environments can result in fish stocks having a high
   susceptibility to infection, with parasites and associated disease one
   of the main factors limiting industry growth. Prediction of infection
   dynamics is key to preventative treatment and mitigation. Considering
   the climatic and technology driven changes facing aquaculture, an
   understanding of how parasites react across a spectrum of conditions is
   required. Here we assessed the impact of temperature, infection density
   and host species on the life history traits of Argulus foliaceus, a
   common palearctic fish louse, representative of a parasite group
   problematic in freshwater aquaculture and fisheries worldwide.
   Temperature significantly affected development, growth and survival;
   parasites hatched and developed faster at higher temperatures, but also
   experienced shorter lifespans when maintained off the host. At high
   temperatures, these parasites will likely experience a short generation
   time as their life history traits are completed more rapidly. A.
   foliaceus additionally grew faster on natural hosts and at lower
   infection densities. Ultimately such results contribute to prediction of
   population dynamics, aiding development of effective control to improve
   animal welfare and reduce industry loss.},

Title = {The highest kingdom of <i>Anolis</i>: Thermal biology of the Andean
   lizard <i>Anolis heterodermus</i> (Squamata: Dactyloidae) over an
   elevational gradient in the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {89},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Vertebrate ectotherms may deal with changes of environmental
   temperatures by behavioral and/or physiological mechanisms. Reptiles
   inhabiting tropical highlands face extreme fluctuating daily
   temperatures, and extreme values and intervals of fluctuations vary with
   altitude. Anolis heterodermus occurs between 1800 m to 3750 m elevation
   in the tropical Andes, and is the Anolis species found at the highest
   altitude known. We evaluated which strategies populations from
   elevations of 2200 m, 2650 m and 3400 m use to cope with environmental
   temperatures. We measured body, preferred, critical maximum and minimum
   temperatures, and sprint speed at different body temperatures of
   individuals, as well as operative temperatures. Anolis heterodermus
   exhibits behavioral adjustments in response to changes in environmental
   temperatures across altitudes. Likewise, physiological traits exhibit
   intrapopulation variations, but they are similar among populations,
   tended to the ``static{''} side of the evolution of thermal traits
   spectrum. The thermoregulatory behavioral strategy in this species is
   extremely plastic, and lizards adjust even to fluctuating environmental
   conditions from day to day. Unlike other Anolis species, at low thermal
   quality of the habitat, lizards are thermoconformers, particularly at
   the highest altitudes, where cloudy days can intensify this strategy
   even more. Our study reveals that the pattern of strategies for dealing
   with thermal ambient variations and their relation to extinction risks
   in the tropics that are caused by global warming is perhaps more complex
   for lizards than previously thought.},

Abstract = {Temperature is one of the key environmental factors affecting the
   eco-physiological responses of living organisms and is considered one of
   the utmost crucial factors in shaping the fundamental niche of a
   species. The purpose of the present study is to delineate the
   physiological response and changes in energy allocation strategy of
   Bellamya bengalensis, a freshwater gastropod in the anticipated summer
   elevated temperature in the future by measuring the growth, body
   conditions (change in total weight, change in organ to flesh weight
   ratio), physiological energetics (ingestion rate, absorption rate,
   respiration rate, excretion rate and Scope for Growth) and thermal
   performance, Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (ABT), thermal critical
   maxima (CTmax), warming tolerance (WT) as well as thermal safety margin
   (TSM) through a mesocosm experiment. We exposed the animals to three
   different temperatures, 25 degrees C (average habitat temperature for
   this animal) and elevated temperatures 30 degrees C, 35 degrees C for 30
   days and changes in energy budget were measured twice (on 15th and 30th
   day). Significant changes were observed in body conditions as well as
   physiological energetics. The total body weight as well as the
   organ/flesh weight ratio, ingestion followed by absorption rate
   decreased whereas, respiration and excretion rate increased with
   elevated temperature treatments resulting in a negative Scope for Growth
   in adverse conditions. Though no profound impact was found on ABT/CTmax,
   the peak of thermal curve was considerably declined for animals that
   were reared in higher temperature treatments. Our data reflects that
   thermal stress greatly impact the physiological functioning and growth
   patterns of B. bengalensis which might jeopardize the freshwater
   ecosystem functioning in future climate change scenario.},

Abstract = {Studies of thermal sensitivity in ectotherms require accurate
   measurements of body temperature using a reliable device, including in
   field situations. In this study, we tested the accuracy of a compact and
   inexpensive mini-infrared thermometer (mini-IRT, 22.3 g) at close
   distance (within 5 mm) for measuring skin surface temperature of small
   lizards or their models (painted copper bars). First, we used copper
   bars to assess the effect of model width on the accuracy of the
   measurement. We placed the heated models on a cool background, and then
   surface temperatures were measured with a mini-IRT for comparison with a
   thermogram from an infrared camera (IRC). We also assessed the accuracy
   of the mini-IRT for measuring skin temperature for two species of small
   lizards in the laboratory and in the field, in comparison with the skin
   surface temperature measured with the IRC and with cloacal temperature
   measured with a thermocouple thermometer. Our results with inanimate
   models show that the accuracy of the mini-IRT at a distance within 5 mm
   is biologically acceptable (within +/- 1.0 degrees C of the mean value
   obtained using a more expensive, calibrated device) when the width is >=
   7 mm. For live lizards, we observed highly significant relationships
   between skin surface temperature measured with the mini-IRT and
   temperatures measured with the two other devices. The mean discrepancies
   between the mini-IRT and other devices were acceptably small for geckos
   but larger for the smaller and more slender skinks. Taken together, our
   results suggest that skin temperature measured with the mini-IRT at a
   close distance is acceptable for field studies on lizards with an
   abdominal width >= 7 min, serving as an inexpensive proxy for core body
   temperature in situations where portability and affordability of
   equipment and minimal animal handling are paramount. Nonetheless,
   calibration of mini-IRTs before use is strongly recommended.},

Title = {Combined local hypothermia and recanalization therapy for acute ischemic
   stroke: Estimation of brain and systemic temperature using an energetic
   numerical model},

Abstract = {Local brain hypothermia is an attractive method for providing cerebral
   neuroprotection for ischemic stroke patients and at the same time
   reducing systemic side effects of cooling. In acute ischemic stroke
   patients with large vessel occlusion, combination with endovascular
   mechanical recanalization treatment could potentially allow for an
   alleviation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways in the critical phase
   of reperfusion. The direct cooling of arterial blood by means of an
   intra-carotid heat exchange catheter compatible with recanalization
   systems is a novel promising approach. Focusing on the concept of ``cold
   reperfusion{''}, we developed an energetic model to calculate the rate
   of temperature decrease during intra-carotid cooling in case of
   physiological as well as decreased perfusion. Additionally, we discussed
   and considered the effect and biological significance of temperature
   decrease on resulting brain perfusion. Our model predicted a 2 degrees C
   brain temperature decrease in 8.3, 11.8 and 26.2 min at perfusion rates
   of 50, 30 and 10 ml/100g.min , respectively. The systemic temperature
   decrease - caused by the venous blood return to the main circulation -
   was limited to 0.5 degrees C in 60 min. Our results underline the
   potential of catheter-assisted, intracarotid blood cooling to provide a
   fast and selective brain temperature decrease in the phase of vessel
   recanalization. This method can potentially allow for a tissue
   hypothermia during the restoration of the physiological flow and thus a
   ``cold reperfusion{''} in the setting of mechanical recanalization.},

Abstract = {Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays an important role in thermoregulation
   and many metabolic processes in small mammals, especially in cold
   adaptation. However, in warm adaptation, ambient temperature cannot
   directly activate BAT by sympathetic nervous system. Mongolian gerbils
   exhibit a wider thermoneutral zone (26.5-38.9 degrees C). We
   hypothesized that BAT atrophied near the lower critical temperature and
   further atrophied near the upper critical temperature. Male gerbils were
   acclimated to 23 degrees C, 27 degrees C or 37 degrees C, respectively,
   for 3 weeks. Results showed that regulatory non-shivering thermogenesis
   did not change in gerbils acclimated to 27 degrees C compared with 23
   degrees C group, whereas it was reduced by 43.5\% in gerbils acclimated
   to 37 degrees C. Bigger lipid droplet in BAT was observed in gerbils
   acclimated to 27 degrees C and 37 degrees C compared with 23 degrees C
   group, while the expression of uncoupling protein 1 and tyrosine
   hydroxylase was only reduced in gerbils acclimated to 37 degrees C.
   Further, thermoneutral acclimation did not change BAT thermogenesis by
   down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
   coactivator-1 alpha, PR domain containing 16, peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor-alpha or peroxisome proliferator
   activated receptor-gamma gene expression in BAT. In addition, body
   temperature was reduced in gerbils acclimated to 37 degrees C compared
   with 23 degrees C group, which was associated with a decreased resting
   metabolic rate and regulatory non-shivering thermogenesis. In
   conclusion, BAT does not atrophy near the lower critical temperature,
   whereas it atrophies near the upper critical temperature, suggesting
   that BAT may play thermoregulatory role within the TNZ in Mongolian
   gerbils.},

Abstract = {To date, the position and shape of the human thermoneutral zone (TNZ)
   remain uncertain. Indications exist that the individual TNZ might be
   influenced by age, body composition and level of acclimatisation. The
   objective of the present study was to explore the individual metabolic
   TNZ, using dynamic thermal conditions to assess both metabolic lower and
   upper critical temperatures (LCT and UCT) and, secondly, to test the
   effect of passive mild heat acclimation on the human metabolic TNZ. A
   dynamic protocol consisting of two experimental conditions was designed:
   starting from a thermoneutral condition (28.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C),
   temperature gradually increased to 37.5 +/- 0.6 degrees C during warming
   (UP) or decreased to 17.8 +/- 0.6 degrees C during cooling (DOWN). For
   six participants, temperature increased further to 41.6 +/- 1.0 degrees
   C during UP. Eleven healthy men (19-31 y) underwent UP and DOWN twice,
   i.e. before and after passive mild heat acclimation (PMHA, 7 days at
   similar to 33 degrees C for 6 h/day). Energy expenditure, body
   temperatures and heart rate were measured during UP and DOWN.
   We show that the generally assumed LCT of approximately 28 degrees C for
   an average male person does not match the dynamically assessed LCTs in
   this study, as those were considerably lower in most cases (23.3 +/- 3.2
   degrees C pre-acclimation; 23.4 +/- 2.0 degrees C post-acclimation).
   Distinct inter-individual variation of the dynamic LCT was evident
   (range pre-PMHA:9.7 degrees C; post-PMHA:5.4 degrees C). Regarding the
   metabolic response to increasing temperatures, only minor or no
   increases in energy metabolism occurred. PMHA did not significantly
   change the positioning of the LCTs, but lowered Tcore (pre-PMHA: -0.13
   +/- 0.13 degrees C, P = 0.011; post-PMHA: -0.14 +/- 0.15 degrees C, P =
   0.026) and affected skin temperature distribution.
   The applied method allowed for the determination of individual dynamic
   LCTs, however, distinct metabolic UCTs were not evident in humans. For a
   better understanding of the human UCT, future studies should incorporate
   individualised temperature ranges and also a measurement of evaporative
   heat loss, to allow for a two-factor analysis of both metabolic and
   evaporative human UCT.},

Abstract = {Prolonged heat stress represents a continuing threat to human health and
   agricultural production. Despite the broad, negative impact of prolonged
   hyperthermia little is known about underlying pathological mechanisms
   leading to negative health outcomes, which has limited the development
   of etiological interventions and left clinicians and producers with only
   cooling and rehydration strategies. The purpose of this investigation
   was to determine the extent to which prolonged environment-induced
   hyperthermia altered autophagy in oxidative skeletal muscle in a large
   animal model, serving the dual purpose of accurately modeling human
   physiology as well as agricultural production. We hypothesized that
   prolonged hyperthermia would induce autophagy in skeletal muscle,
   independent of the accompanying caloric restriction. To test this
   hypothesis pigs were treated as follows: thermoneutral (20 degrees C),
   heat stress (35 degrees C), or were held under thermoneutral conditions
   but pair-fed to the heat stress group for seven days. Upon euthanasia
   the red portion of the semitendinosus was collected. We found that
   prolonged hyperthermic exposure increased oxidative stress without a
   corresponding change in antioxidant enzyme activities. Hyperthermia
   prevented initiation of autophagy despite increased markers of
   nucleation, elongation and autophagosome formation. However, p62
   relative protein abundance, which is inversely correlated with
   autophagic degradation, was strongly increased suggesting suppressed
   degradation of autophagosomes. Markers of mitophagy and mitochondrial
   abundance were largely similar between groups. These data indicate that
   faulty autophagy plays a key role in hyperthermic muscle dysfunction.},

Title = {A new method of estimating thermal performance of embryonic development

Abstract = {Temperature has a strong effect on ectotherm development rate. It is
   therefore possible to construct predictive models of development that
   rely solely on temperature, which have applications in a range of
   biological fields. Here, we leverage a reference series of development
   stages for embryos of the turtle Chelydra serpentina, which was
   described at a constant temperature of 20 degrees C. The reference
   series acts to map each distinct developmental stage onto embryonic age
   (in days) at 20 degrees C. By extension, an embryo taken from any given
   incubation environment, once staged, can be assigned an equivalent age
   at 20 degrees C. We call this concept ``Equivalent Development{''}, as
   it maps the development stage of an embryo incubated at a given
   temperature to its equivalent age at a reference temperature. In the
   laboratory, we used the concept of Equivalent Development to estimate
   development rate of embryos of C. serpentina across a series of constant
   temperatures. Using these estimates of development rate, we created a
   thermal performance curve measured in units of Equivalent Development
   (TPCED). We then used the TPCED to predict developmental stage of
   embryos in several natural turtle nests across six years. We found that
   85\% of the variation of development stage in natural nests could be
   explained. Further, we compared the predictive accuracy of the model
   based on the TPCED to the predictive accuracy of a degree-day model,
   where development is assumed to be linearly related to temperature and
   the amount of accumulated heat is summed over time. Information theory
   suggested that the model based on the TPCED better describes variation
   in developmental stage in wild nests than the degree-day model. We
   suggest the concept of Equivalent Development has several strengths and
   can be broadly applied. In particular, studies on temperature-dependent
   sex determination may be facilitated by the concept of Equivalent
   Development, as development age maps directly onto the developmental
   series of the organism, allowing critical periods of sex determination
   to be delineated without invasive sampling, even under fluctuating
   temperature.},

Title = {Temperature effects on aerobic scope and cardiac performance of European
   perch (<i>Perca fluviatilis</i>)},

Abstract = {Several recent studies have highlighted how impaired cardiac performance
   at high temperatures and in hypoxia may compromise the capacity for
   oxygen transport. Thus, at high temperatures impaired cardiac capacity
   is proposed to reduce oxygen transport to a degree that lowers aerobic
   scope and compromises thermal tolerance (the oxygen- and
   capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis). To investigate
   this hypothesis, we measured aerobic and cardiac performance of a
   eurythermal freshwater teleost, the European perch (Perca fluviatilis).
   Rates of oxygen consumption were measured during rest and activity at
   temperatures between 5 degrees C and 27 degrees C, and we evaluated
   cardiac function by in vivo measurements of heart rate and in vitro
   studies to determine contractility of myocardial strips. Aerobic scope
   increased progressively from 5 degrees C to 21 degrees C, after which it
   levelled off. Heart rate showed a similar response. We found little
   difference between resting and active heart rate at high temperature
   suggesting that increased cardiac scope during activity is primarily
   related to changes in stroke volume. To examine the effects of
   temperature on cardiac capacity, we measured isometric force development
   in electrically paced myocardial preparations during different
   combinations of temperature, pacing frequency, oxygenation and
   adrenergic stimulation. The force-frequency product increased markedly
   upon adrenergic stimulation at 21 and 27 degrees C (with higher effects
   at 21 degrees C) and the cardiac preparations were highly sensitive to
   hypoxia. These findings suggest that at (critically) high temperatures,
   cardiac output may diminish due to a decreased effect of adrenergic
   stimulation and that this effect may be further exacerbated if the heart
   becomes hypoxic. Hence cardiac limitations may contribute to the
   inability to increase aerobic scope at high temperatures in the European
   perch (Perca fluviatilis).},

Abstract = {The ability for effective, accurate and precise thermoregulation is of
   paramount importance for ectotherms. Sympatric lizards often partition
   their niche and select different microhabitats. These microhabitats,
   however, usually differ in their thermal conditions and lizards have to
   adapt their thermoregulation behavior accordingly. Here, we evaluated
   the impact of habitat partitioning on the thermal biology of three
   syntopic, congeneric lacertids (Podarcis peloponnesiacus, P. tauricus
   and P. muralis) from central Peloponnese, Greece. We assessed
   thermoregulation effectiveness (E) using the three standard thermal
   parameters: body (T-b), operative (T-e) and preferred (T-pref)
   temperatures. We hypothesized that the microhabitats used by each
   species would differ in thermal quality. We also predicted that all
   species would effectively thermoregulate, as they inhabit a thermally
   challenging mountain habitat. As expected, the partition of the habitat
   had an effect on the thermoregulation of lizards since microhabitats had
   different thermal qualities. All three species were effective and
   accurate thermoregulators but one of them achieved smaller E values as a
   result of the lower T-b in the field. This discrepancy could be
   attributed to the cooler (but more benign) thermal microhabitats that
   this species occupies.},

Title = {Has contemporary climate change played a role in population declines of
   the lizard <i>Ctenophorus decresii</i> from semi-arid Australia?},

Abstract = {Whilst contemporary climatic changes are small in magnitude compared to
   those predicted for the coming decades, they have already been linked to
   species range shifts and local extinctions. Elucidating the drivers
   behind species' responses to contemporary climate change will better
   inform management strategies for vulnerable and pest species alike. A
   recent proposal to explain worldwide local extinctions in lizards is
   that increasing maximum temperatures have constrained lizard activity
   time in the breeding season beyond extinction thresholds. Here we
   document a significant population decline and potential local extinction
   at the warm (northern) range margin of the tawny dragon, Ctenophorus
   decresii, a rock-dwelling lizard from the Flinders Ranges in semi-arid
   Australia. We developed and tested a biophysical model of tawny dragon
   thermoregulatory behaviour and drove the model with daily weather data
   for the period 1990-2009 across the Flinders Ranges. Our results
   indicate that potential annual activity time has likely increased over
   this period throughout the historic range, with within-season declines
   only in the summer months at the northern range limit. However,
   populations that have declined since 2000 have also likely experienced
   higher active body temperatures and more stringent retreat-site
   requirements (deeper crevices) than have regions where the species
   remains common, during a period of declining rainfall. Our laboratory
   estimates of thermal preference in this species were insensitive to
   altered nutritional and hydric state. Thus it is possible that recent
   population declines are linked to desiccation stress driven by higher
   body temperatures and declining rainfall. Our study illustrates that
   simple indices of the impact of climate warming on animals, such as
   activity restriction, may in fact reflect a variety of potential
   mechanisms whose ultimate outcome will be contingent on other factors
   such as water and shelter availability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Influence of water temperature and waterborne cadmium toxicity on growth

Abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) is believed to be one of the most abundant and ubiquitously
   distributed toxins in the aquatic system. This metal is released to the
   aquatic environment from both anthropogenic sources, such as industrial,
   agricultural and urban effluents as well as natural sources, such as
   rocks and soils. Otherwise, the temperature increase of water bodies,
   which has been observed due to global climatic changes, has been shown
   to increase Cd toxicity for several aquatic animal species including
   fish. In the present study. Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloricus (L),
   (26.0 +/- 0.38 g) were reared at 20, 24, 28, or 32 degrees C and exposed
   to 0.0 or 0.5 mg Cd/L for 8 weeks to investigate effects of water
   temperature, Cd toxicity and their interaction on fish performance as
   well as metallothionein (MT) and Cd distribution in different fish
   organs. It was found that fish reared in Cd-free group at 28 degrees C
   showed the optimum growth and feed intake, while Cd-exposed fish showed
   low growth and feed intake irrespective to water temperature. A
   synergetic relationship between water temperature and Cd toxicity was
   observed where Cd toxicity increased as water temperature increased and
   the worse growth was obtained in Cd-exposed fish reared at 32 degrees C.
   Additionally, the highest Cd residues in different fish organs were
   detected in Cd-exposed fish reared at 32 degrees C. Similarly, MT
   concentrations in different fish organs increased as water temperature
   increased especially in Cd-exposed fish groups. A high positive
   correlation between MT and Cd concentrations in fish organs was
   detected. The distribution of MT and Cd levels was in the order of liver
   > kidney > gills > muscles. The present study revealed that the optimum
   water temperature suitable for Nile tilapia growth is 28 degrees C.
   Additionally, Cd exposure had a deteriorate effect on the growth and
   health of Nile tilapia. This hazardous effect increased as water
   temperature increased. Further, liver and kidney were the prime sites of
   Cd accumulation, while Cd load in the muscles was the lowest as compared
   to the other investigated organs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Seawater temperature is an important environmental factor for the early
   life stages of marine invertebrates. In this study we evaluated and
   described the effects of temperature during early development of E.
   chloroticus, identifying the optimum temperature range and upper thermal
   limit for successful development. The temperature range evaluated was
   between 15-24 degrees C which included the normal seawater temperatures
   during the spawning season in northern New Zealand, as well as the
   highest temperature projected by the IPCC for this region due to global
   warming (1-3 degrees C by the year 2100). Gametes from several females
   and males were used in the experiment. Fertilization was carried out at
   different temperatures and development was monitored at different time
   points after fertilization in each temperature. The development rate of
   E. chloroticus increased with an increase in seawater temperature.
   However, at temperatures higher than 21.5 degrees C the amount of
   abnormal development reached similar to 30\%. The optimum temperature
   for early development was between 15-21 degrees C, whereas the upper
   thermal limit was similar to 24 degrees C. Therefore, early development
   of E. chloroticus is negatively affected by an increase in seawater
   temperature of similar to 3-4 degrees C above current seawater
   temperature levels in northern New Zealand. The thermal sensitivity of
   early life stages of E. chloroticus could affect survival rates during
   early development of this species in a global warming scenario, which
   could impair recruitment in populations which are exposed to higher
   temperatures, leading to possible distributional shifts of this species.

Title = {Bat thermoregulation in the heat: seasonal variation in evaporative
   cooling capacities in four species of European bats},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {123},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Phenotypic flexibility is an important source of physiological variation
   in endotherms and plays an integral role in species' response to rapid
   environmental changes. Studies of phenotypic flexibility have focused on
   winter acclimatization and cold endurance, and there are fewer data on
   summer acclimatization and adjustments in heat dissipation capacity,
   especially in Temperate-Zone species. We used indirect calorimetry and
   thermometry to test if thermoregulation at high air temperatures (Ta) T
   a ) varies between spring and summer in four species of European
   vespertilionid bats: Nyctalus noctula, , Pipistrellus nathusii, , P .
   pygmaeus, , and P . pipistrellus. . We measured subcutaneous body
   temperature (Tsub), T sub ), evaporative water loss, and resting
   metabolic rate while exposing bats to a stepped profile of increasing T
   a , from 28 degrees C-48 degrees C. We predicted that during summer,
   bats increase heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity, to better
   tolerate hotter T a s. In contrast, we found lower maximum ratios of
   evaporative heat loss (EHL) to metabolic heat production (MHP) during
   summer, but no seasonal differences in maximum T a tolerated or T sub .
   The main cause of this seasonal difference in maximum EHL/MHP seems to
   be from bats increasing EWL more gradually with increasing T a in summer
   than spring, particularly in the smaller Pipistrellus species.
   Therefore, this seasonal variation in heat-dissipation strategies may
   reflect enhanced water conservation during summer to avoid dehydration,
   as bats are confined to roosts for longer and hotter days compared to
   spring.},

Abstract = {Thermal tolerance data are important for identifying the potential range
   of non-native species following introduction and establishment. Such
   data are particularly important for understanding invasion risks of
   tropical species introduced to temperate climates and identifying
   whether they can survive outside tropical regions. A breeding population
   of the tropical clawed frog ( Xenopus tropicalis ) was recently
   discovered in west-central Florida, U.S.A. This fully aquatic species is
   native to the rainforest belt of west Africa and has not been documented
   outside its native range. Because of the lack of invasion history, data
   are sparse on the thermal limits for this species. We used chronic
   lethal and critical thermal methodologies to investigate thermal
   tolerance on adult stages and critical thermal methods on tadpoles.
   Because of our use of both chronic and critical methodologies, we also
   examined the literature to reveal common methods used to investigate
   thermal minimum and maximum temperature in amphibians, which were found
   to be dominated by the critical maximum. Chronic lethal temperatures for
   adult X. tropicalis were 9.73 degrees C and 36.68 degrees C. Critical
   temperatures were affected by acclimation temperature and life stage;
   adults were more tolerant of extreme temperatures. Based on these
   critical thermal data and the fact that breeding tends to occur when
   temperatures are suitable for survival, tadpole stages are unlikely to
   be affected by extreme temperatures. Instead, range expansion in Florida
   will likely be limited by the adult stages. Our findings indicate that
   the tropical clawed frog could occupy much of southern Peninsular
   Florida and other tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.},

Title = {Role of thermosensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in
   thermal preference of male and female mice},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {122},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channels are important for
   sensing environmental temperature. In rodents, TRPV4 senses warmth
   (25-34 degrees C), TRPV1 senses heat (>42 degrees C), TRPA1 putatively
   senses cold (<17 degrees C), and TRPM8 senses cool -cold (18-26 degrees
   C). We investigated if knockout (KO) mice lacking these TRP channels
   exhibited changes in thermal preference. Thermal preference was tested
   using a dual hot -cold plate with one thermoelectric surface set at 30
   degrees C and the adjacent surface at a temperature of 15-45 degrees C
   in 5 degrees C increments. Blinded observers counted the number of times
   mice crossed through an opening between plates and the percentage of
   time spent on the 30 degrees C plate. In a separate experiment,
   observers blinded as to genotype also assessed the temperature at the
   location on a thermal gradient (1.83 m, 4-50 degrees C) occupied by the
   mouse at 5- or 10 -min intervals over 2 h. Male and female wildtype mice
   preferred 30 degrees C and significantly avoided colder (15-20 degrees
   C) and hotter (40-45 degrees C) temperatures. Male TRPV1KOs and
   TRPA1KOs, and TRPV4KOs of both sexes, were similar, while female WTs,
   TRPV1KOs, TRPA1KOs and TRPM8KOs did not show significant thermal
   preferences across the temperature range. Male and female TRPM8KOs did
   not significantly avoid the coldest temperatures. Male mice (except for
   TRPM8KOs) exhibited significantly fewer plate crossings at hot and cold
   temperatures and more crossings at thermoneutral temperatures, while
   females exhibited a similar but non -significant trend. Occupancy
   temperatures along the thermal gradient exhibited a broad distribution
   that shrank somewhat over time. Mean occupancy temperatures (recorded at
   90-120 min) were significantly higher for females (30-34 degrees C)
   compared to males (26-27 degrees C) of all genotypes, except for
   TRPA1KOs which exhibited no sex difference. The results indicate (1) sex
   differences with females (except TRPA1KOs) preferring warmer
   temperatures, (2) reduced thermosensitivity in female TRPV1KOs, and (3)
   reduced sensitivity to cold and innocuous warmth in male and female
   TRPM8KOs consistent with previous studies.},

Title = {Impaired autophagy following ex vivo cooling of simulated hypothermic
   temperatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from young and older
   adults},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Hypothermia is a critical consequence of extreme cold exposure that
   increases the risk of cold -related injury and death in humans. While
   the initiation of cytoprotective mechanisms including the process of
   autophagy and the heat shock response (HSR) is crucial to cellular
   survival during periods of stress, age -related decrements in these
   systems may underlie cold -induced cellular vulnerability in older
   adults. Moreover, whether potential sex -related differences in
   autophagic regulation influence the human cold stress response remain
   unknown. We evaluated the effect of age and sex on mechanisms of
   cytoprotection (autophagy and the HSR) and cellular stress (apoptotic
   signaling and the acute inflammatory response) during ex vivo
   hypothermic cooling. Venous blood samples from 20 healthy young (10
   females; mean {[}SD]: 22 {[}2] years) and 20 healthy older (10 females;
   66 {[}5] years) adults were either isolated immediately (baseline) for
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or exposed to water bath
   temperatures maintained at 37, 35, 33, 31, or 4 degrees C for 90 min
   before PBMC isolation. Proteins associated with autophagy, apoptosis,
   the HSR, and inflammation were analyzed via Western blotting. Indicators
   of autophagic initiation and signaling (LC3, ULK1, and beclin-2) and the
   HSR (HSP90 and HSP70) increased when exposed to hypothermic temperatures
   in young and older adults (all p <= 0.007). Sex -related differences
   were only observed with autophagic initiation (ULK1; p = 0.015).
   However, despite increases in autophagic initiators ULK1 and beclin-2
   (all p < 0.001), this was paralleled by autophagic dysfunction
   (increased p62) in all groups (all p < 0.001). Further, apoptotic
   (cleaved-caspase-3) and inflammatory (IL -6 and TNF- alpha) signaling
   increased in all groups (all p < 0.001). We demonstrated that exposure
   to hypothermic conditions is associated with autophagic dysfunction,
   irrespective of age or sex, although there may exist innate sex -related
   differences in cytoprotection in response to cold exposure as evidenced
   through altered autophagic initiation.},

Title = {Combined effects of temperature and diet on the performance of larvae

Abstract = {Seasonal variations in environmental conditions determine the success of
   decapod larval development, and females transmit more energy in
   sub-optimal conditions to maximise the fitness of their offspring. The
   objective of this study was to focus on the combined effects of
   temperature (14, 18 and 22 degree celsius) and food quality on the
   performance of larvae produced by 5 young (0+) and 5 old (I+) Palaemon
   serratus females. We prepared 3 diets based on Artemia, in decreasing
   order of total fatty acid content: freshly hatched nauplii (N),
   unenriched metanauplii (M) and metanauplii enriched with a mixture of
   microalgae (ME). At hatching, the larvae produced by I+ females had a
   higher biomass but a similar fatty acid concentration to those produced
   by 0+ females. Larvae survived better and developed relatively faster as
   temperature increased, and the longer they waited to metamorphose, the
   greater their weight at metamorphosis. These performances were
   diet-dependent, with more survival and more growth in less time with
   diet N than with the other two. Larvae from I+ females performed better
   than those from 0+ females, especially under the most stressful
   conditions. The greater biomass of the larvae of I+ females seems to
   have enabled them to follow a shorter, and therefore faster, development
   path than those of 0+ females. The larvae's diet also had an impact on
   post-metamorphic composition: larvae eating a diet richer in fatty acids
   produced richer juveniles and those eating a poorer diet produced
   juveniles with slightly more essential fatty acids. This study supports
   the high plasticity of caridean shrimp larval development and the
   importance of maternal effects on the fitness of offspring.},

Title = {How plastic are upper thermal limits? A comparative study in tsetse
   (family: Glossinidae) and wider Diptera},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {118},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) describes the upper thermal tolerance
   of an animal where biological functions start to fail. A period of
   acclimation can enhance CTmax through plasticity, potentially buffering
   animals from extreme temperatures caused by climate change. Basal and
   acclimated CTmax vary within and between species and may be explained by
   traits related to thermal physiology, such as body size and sex.
   Differences in CTmax have not been established among species of tsetse
   fly (Glossina spp.), vectors of animal and human African
   trypanosomiasis. Here, we investigated basal CTmax and its plasticity
   for five tsetse species following adult acclimation at constant 25 or 30
   degrees C for five days. We then set our findings in context using a
   meta-analysis on 33 species of Diptera. We find that, of the five tsetse
   species considered, only Glossina palpalis gambiensis and Glossina
   brevipalpis exhibited plasticity of CTmax, with an increase of 0.12
   degrees C and 0.10 degrees C per 1 degrees C acclimation respectively.
   Within some species, higher basal CTmax values were associated with
   larger body size and being female, while variation in plasticity (i.e.,
   response to the acclimation temperature) could not be explained by sex
   or size. Our broader meta-analysis across Diptera revealed overall CTmax
   plasticity of 0.06 degrees C per 1 degrees C acclimation, versus a
   similar 0.05 degrees C mean increase in tsetse. In contrast, there was
   greater CTmax plasticity in males compared to females in Diptera. Our
   study highlights that CTmax and its plasticity varies even among closely
   related species. Broader patterns across groups are not always reflected
   at a finer resolution; we thus emphasise the need for detailed
   experimental studies across a wide range of insect species to capture
   their capacity to cope with rapidly warming temperatures.},

Title = {Exploring the impact of temporal heat stress on skeletal muscle
   hypertrophy in bovine myocytes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {117},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The primary aim of this investigation was to explore the impact of
   different temporal stress conditions on the regulators associated with
   skeletal muscle hypertrophy in bovine myocytes. Bovine satellite cells
   (BSCs) were extracted from three-month-old Holstein bull calves and
   subjected to myogenic differentiation under three thermal treatments: 38
   C (control; CON), 39.5 C (moderate heat stress; MHS), and 41 C (extreme
   heat stress; EHS) for a duration of 3 or 48 h. Exposure to EHS resulted
   in elevated (P < 0.01) expression levels of heat shock protein (HSP)20,
   HSP27, HSP70, and HSP90, along with increased (P < 0.01) protein levels.
   Moreover, cells exposed to MHS and EHS exhibited enhanced (P < 0.01)
   gene expression of myoblast determination protein 1 (MyoD), while
   myogenin (MyoG) was overexpressed (P < 0.01) in cells exposed to EHS.
   These findings suggest that heat exposure can potentially induce
   myogenic differentiation through the modulation of myogenic regulatory
   factors. Furthermore, our investigations revealed that exposure to EHS
   upregulated (P < 0.01) myosin heavy chain (MHC) I expression, whereas
   MHC IIA (P < 0.01) and IIX (P < 0.01) expression were increased; P <
   0.01) under MHS conditions. These observations suggest that the
   temperature of the muscle may alter the proportion of muscle fiber
   types. Additionally, our data indicated that EHS activated (P < 0.01)
   the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and triggered the
   activation of the Akt/mTOR/S6KB1 pathway, a known anabolic pathway
   associated with cellular protein synthesis. Consequently, these altered
   signaling pathways contributed to enhanced protein synthesis and
   increased myotube size. Overall, the results obtained from our current
   study revealed that extreme heat exposure (41 C) may promote skeletal
   muscle hypertrophy by regulating myogenic regulatory factors and
   IGF-1-mediated mTOR pathway in bovine myocytes.},

Title = {Effect of abnormal values of three temperature indicators on ischemic
   stroke hospital admissions in Guangzhou, China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {116},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Abnormal temperature has important effects on the occurrence of ischemic
   stroke (IS). However, relatively less efforts have been taken to
   systematically unravel the association between various abnormal
   temperature and IS hospital admission. Focusing on three temperature
   indicators (i.e., mean temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum
   temperature), this study attempts to analyse how their abnormal values
   affect IS hospital admission. The dataset covers the period between
   September 17, 2012 and August 28, 2018, and includes a total of 1464
   cases who were admitted to the hospital for the first onset of IS and
   lived in the main urban area of Guangzhou. The study adopts the
   time-stratified case-crossover analysis. Abnormal values of temperature
   were measured using the 2.5th and 97.5th quantile values of each
   temperature indicator, with the former refers to a low value whereas the
   latter a high one. The effects of abnormal temperature on IS hospital
   admission were assessed through calculating the relative risks induced
   by the low and high values (the median values of each temperature
   indicators were taken as the references). The results show that the risk
   window periods for IS hospital admission associated with the low values
   of the temperature indicators are the lags of 3-7 days and 18-19 days.
   The risks of high temperature values on IS admission, however, are
   insignificant with either one-day lag or cumulative lag. As to different
   population groups, females show higher risks of IS hospital admission at
   low temperature values than males; and elderly people, compared with
   young people, are more vulnerable to low temperature values. To cities
   with similar climate of Guangzhou, particular attention should be paid
   to the impact of low temperature values, especially the low value of
   minimum temperature, on IS admission, and to females and elderly people
   who are more sensitive to abnormal temperatures.},

Title = {Thermal biology in the Upper Galili Mountain blind mole rat (Nannospalax
   galili) and an overview of spalacine energetics},

Abstract = {Several hundred mammalian species thrive in complex burrow systems,
   which protect them from climatic ex-tremes and predation. At the same
   time, it is also a stressful environment due to low food supply, high
   humidity, and, in some cases, a hypoxic and hypercapnic atmosphere. To
   face such conditions, subterranean rodents have convergently evolved low
   basal metabolic rate, high minimal thermal conductance and low body
   temperature. Although these parameters have been intensively studied in
   the last decades, such information is far from being well-known in one
   of the most studied groups of subterranean rodents, the blind mole rats
   of the genus Nan-nospalax. The lack of information is particularly
   noticeable for parameters such as the upper critical temperature and the
   width of the thermoneutral zone. In our study, we analysed the
   energetics of the Upper Galilee Mountain blind mole rat Nannospalax
   galili and found its basal metabolic rate of 0.84 \& PLUSMN; 0.10 mL
   O2xg-1 x h-1, thermoneutral zone between 28 and 35 degrees C, mean Tb
   within the zone of 36.3 \& PLUSMN; 0.6 degrees C, and minimal thermal
   conductance equal to 0.082 mL O2xg-1 x h-1 x C-1. Nannospalax galili is
   a truly homeothermic rodent well adapted to face lower ambient
   temperatures, because its Tb was stable down to the lowest temperature
   measured (10 degrees C). At the same time, a relatively high basal
   metabolic rate and relatively low minimal thermal conductance for a
   subterranean rodent of such body mass, and the difficulty of surviving
   ambient temperatures slightly above upper critical temperature,
   indicates problems with sufficient heat dissipation at higher
   temperatures. This can easily lead to overheating, that is relevant
   mainly during the hot-dry season. These findings suggest that N. galili
   can be threatened by ongoing global climate change.},

Abstract = {The global average temperature will increase by up to 5.7 degrees C,
   under high greenhouse gas emissions, consequently increasing the
   frequency of heatwaves, according to recent IPCC forecasts. These
   especially impacts ectotherms, such as insects, which are the most
   susceptible animals to changes in environmental temperature, affecting
   their physiology and reproduction. Thus, we investigated the effects of
   a 96-h exposure to constant temperatures (CT: 27, 30.5, 34, 39, 41, or
   43 degrees C) and fluctuating temperatures (FT: 27/34 degrees C, 12/12
   h) on the survival, metabolic rate, and oviposition of the female
   cricket Gryllus (Gryllus) assimilis (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Mortality,
   body mass and water content of females and males were quantified and
   compared. It was found that CT27, CT34 and FT27/34 do not cause
   mortality in females of G. (G.) assimilis. CT30.5 (average temperature
   between 27 and 34), despite causing mortality of 5.0 +/- 3.5\%, do not
   differ from CT27, CT34 or FT27/34. CT39 causes a mortality of 8.3 +/-
   5.5\%. Estimated lethal temperature for 50\% of the population of
   females (LT50Temp) is 40 degrees C, and 43 degrees C promotes 100\%
   mortality in 96 h. Comparing mortality between sexes, females present
   higher LT50Temp and thermotolerance than males. In addition, FT27/34 and
   CT34 do not differ in the metabolic rate, but both have higher values
   than CT27. CT34 strongly reduces oviposition in females, however FT27/34
   does not. We suggest that CT34 reduces oviposition in females in two
   ways: by affecting the endocrine system related to egg production, or by
   causing behavioral egg retention, as a strategy to survive thermal
   stress. Moreover, females had a higher wet body mass and present a lower
   average weight loss than males. In conclusion, despite females present a
   higher mortality at temperatures above 39 degrees C, they are more
   thermotolerant than males. Furthermore, CT34 is detrimental to the
   oviposition of G. (G.) assimilis.},

Title = {Modulation of acyl and des-acyl ghrelin on autonomic and behavioral
   thermoregulation in various ambient temperatures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Maintenance of body temperature (Tb) at various ambient temperatures
   (Ta) during fasting is important for homeotherms. Fasting decreases Tb
   in thermoneutral and cold conditions and facilitates thermoregulatory
   behavior in the cold in rats; however, the mechanism is unknown. We
   focused on ghrelin, a hormone secreted by the stomach during fasting, in
   two circulatory forms: acyl ghrelin (AG) and des-acyl ghrelin (DAG). AG
   is called active ghrelin, while DAG, the non-active ghrelin, was unknown
   for a long time before its many functions were recently clarified. In
   the present review, we present the modulation of AG and DAG on autonomic
   and behavioral thermoregulation at various Ta and discuss the
   differences between their modulation on thermoregulation. AG decreases
   Tb in thermoneutral and cold conditions but does not affect the
   thermoregulatory behavior of rodents in cold conditions. The DAG
   decreases Tb in thermoneutral and hot conditions, but it does not affect
   Tb and facilitates the thermoregulatory behavior of rodents in the cold.
   These findings indicate that the actions of AG and DAG on
   thermoregulation are similar in thermoneutral conditions but are
   different in cold conditions.},

Abstract = {Comprehension of thermal behavior underlying the living biological
   tissues helps successful applications of current heat therapies. The
   present work is to explore the heat transport properties of irradiated
   tissue during tis thermal treatment, in which the local thermal
   non-equilibrium effect as well as temperature-dependent prop-erties
   arose from complicated anatomical structure, is considered. Based on the
   generalized dual-phase lag (GDPL) model, a non-linear governing equation
   of tissue temperature with variable thermal physical properties is
   proposed. The effective procedure constructed on an explicit finite
   difference scheme is then developed to predict numerically the thermal
   response and thermal damage irradiated by a pulse laser as a therapeutic
   heat source. The parametric study on variable thermal physical
   parameters including the phase lag times, heat conductivity, specific
   heat capacity and blood perfusion rate has been performed to evaluate
   their influence on temperature distribution in time and space. On this
   basis, the thermal damage with different laser variables such as laser
   intensity and exposure time are further analyzed.},

Abstract = {Non-invasive and contactless infrared thermography (IRT) measurements
   have been claimed to indicate acute neural, cardiovascular, and
   thermoregulatory adaptations during exercise. Due to challenging
   comparability, reproducibility, and objectivity, investigations
   considering different exercise types and intensities, and automatic ROI
   analysis are currently needed. Thus, we aimed to examine surface
   radiation temperature (Tsr) variations during different exercise types
   and intensities in the same individuals, ROI, and environmental
   conditions. Ten healthy, active males performed a cardiopulmonary
   exercise test on a treadmill in the first week and on a cycling
   ergometer the following week. Respiration, heart rate, lactate, rated
   perceived exertion, the mean, minimum, and maximum Tsr of the right calf
   (CTsr (degrees C)), and the surface radiation temperature pattern (CPsr)
   were explored. We executed two-way rmANOVA and Spearman's rho
   correlation analyses. Across all IRT parameters, mean CTsr showed the
   highest association to cardiopulmonary parameters (E.g., oxygen
   consumption: rs =-0.612 (running);-0.663 (cycling); p < .001). A global
   significant difference of CTsr was identified between all relevant
   exercise test increments for both exercise-types (p < .001; eta 2p =
   .842) and between both exercise-types (p = .045; eta 2p = .205).
   Differences in CTsr between running and cycling significantly appeared
   after a 3-min recovery period, whereas lactate, heart rate, and oxygen
   consumption were not different. High correlations between the CTsr
   values extracted manually and the CTsr values processed automatically by
   a deep neural network were identified. The applied objective time series
   analysis enables crucial insights into intra-and interindividual
   differences between both tests. CTsr variations indicate different
   physiological demands between incremental running and cycling exercise
   testing. Further studies applying automatic ROI analyses are needed to
   enable the extensive analysis of inter-and intraindividual factors
   influencing the CTsr variation during exercise to allow determine the
   criterion and predictive validity of IRT parameters in exercise
   physiology.},

Title = {Comparative transcriptome analysis of<i> Callosobruchus</i><i>
   chinensis</i> (L.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae-Bruchinae) after heat and
   cold stress exposure},

Abstract = {Callosobruchus chinensis is regarded as one of the cosmopolitan pests of
   legume crops and can cause tremendous losses to a variety of beans. This
   study focused on comparative transcriptome analyses of C. chinensis
   exposed to 45 degrees C (heat stress), 27 degrees C (ambient
   temperature) and -3 degrees C (cold stress) for 3 h to investigate the
   gene differences and underlying molecular mechanisms. There were 402 and
   111 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in the heat and
   cold stress treatments, respectively. ``cell process{''}, ``cell{''} and
   ``binding{''} were the main enriched functions and biological processes
   revealed by gene ontology (GO) analysis. The clusters of orthologous
   genes (COG) showed that DEGs were assigned to the categories:
   ``posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones{''},
   ``lipid transport and metabolism{''}, and ``general function prediction
   only{''}. With respect to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
   (KEGG), the ``longevity regulating pathway-multiple species{''},
   ``carbon metabolism{''}, ``peroxisome{''}, ``protein processing in
   endoplasmic{''}, ``glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism{''} pathways
   were significantly enriched. The annotation and enrichment analysis
   revealed that genes encoding heat shock proteins (Hsps) and cuticular
   proteins were significantly upregulated under high and low-temperature
   stresses, respectively. In addition, some DEGs encoding ``Protein lethal
   essential for life{''}, ``Reverse transcriptase{''}, ``DnaJ domain{''},
   ``Cytochrome{''} and ``Zinc finger protein{''} were also upregulated to
   varying degrees. Transcriptomic data were validated using qRT-PCR, which
   confirmed that they were consistent. In this paper, the temperature
   tolerance of C. chinensis adults was evaluated and the results showed
   that female adults were more sensitive to heat and cold stress than
   males, and the upregulation of heat shock protein and epidermal protein
   was the largest in DEGs after heat and cold stress, respectively. These
   findings provide a reference for further understanding the biological
   characteristics of C. chinensis adults and the molecular mechanisms
   underlying the response to low and high temperatures.},

Title = {The change in biocomfort zones in the area of Mug?la province in near
   future due to the global climate change scenarios},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {112},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {It is inevitable that the global climate change, which has important
   effects on the climate throughout the world, would have significant
   effects on the biocomfort zones. Hence, how global climate change will
   change the biocomfort zones should be determined and the data to be
   obtained should be used in urban planning projects. In the current
   study, SSPs 245 and SSPs 585 scenarios were taken as a basis, and the
   potential effects of global climate change on the biocomfort zones in
   Mugla province, Turkiye were investigated. Within the scope of the
   present study, the current status of biocomfort zones in Mugla and their
   possible conditions in years 2040, 2060, 2080, and 2100 were compared
   using DI and ETv methods. At the end of the study, it was estimated
   that, ac-cording DI method, 14.13\% of Mugla province are in cold zone,
   31.96\% in cool zone, and 53.71\% in comfortable zone. According to the
   SSPs 585 scenario, together with the increase in temperature, the cold
   and cool zones will totally disappear in year 2100, comfortable zones
   will decrease to 31.22\%, and approx. 68.78\% of the province will be in
   hot zone. According to the calculations made using ETv method, Mugla
   province currently consists of moderately cold zones by 2\%, quite cold
   zones by 13.16\%, slightly cold zones by 57.06\%, and mild zones by
   27.79\%. Based on the SSPs 585 scenario for the year 2100, it is
   projected that Mugla will consist of slightly cool zones by 1.41\%, mild
   zones by 14.42\%, and comfortable zones by 68.06\%, besides warm zones
   by 16.11\% which are not present at this moment. This finding suggests
   that especially the cooling costs will increase and the air-conditioning
   systems to be used will negatively affect the global climate change
   through the energy consumption and the gases used.},

Abstract = {Numerical simulation of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia for cancer
   treatment has been investigated in this study. The presented simulation
   did account for the effects of fluid flow, mass flow, and heat transfer
   during the MNP hyperthermia. The tumor was assumed to be a porous slab,
   30\% of which had been necrosed previously, with two capillaries, where
   magnetic nanoparticles were added into the bloodstream and distributed
   in the tumor by blood flow through capillaries. Fluid flow, mass
   transfer by capillaries, and interstitial tissues have been coupled in
   this study. Furthermore, tumor tissue damage has been calculated using a
   thermal damage indicator. The goal of this research is to find an
   optimum injection duration and exposure time in order to maximize
   hy-perthermia treatment effectiveness using the BOBYQA optimization
   method. At the end of the 1-h time hyper-thermia treatment, most of the
   non-necrotic tissue of the tumor were damaged. Moreover, the fraction of
   damaged tissue increased to more than 90\% in some parts of the tumor.
   Results of this study indicate that MNP hyperthermia with the proposed
   setup can effectively damage the tumor in just one session, making it
   more susceptible to complementary therapies such as radiotherapy or
   chemotherapy.},

Title = {Firefighter salivary cortisol responses following rapid heat stress},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {108},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This research evaluated the impact of rapid heat stress on the rate of
   salivary cortisol appearance. We hypothesized that rapid heat stress
   would result in an increased rate of salivary cortisol appearance.
   Fourteen adult male participants performed an incremental exercise test
   to a termination criterion (volitional maximum, core temperature = 39.5
   degrees C, or a 2-h time maximum time) with or without firefighting gear
   in a laboratory with an ambient temperature of 25-26 degrees C. Salivary
   cortisol was collected at each 0.5 degrees C increase in core
   temperature. We observed a significant increase (p <= 0.01) in the rate
   of cortisol appearance when the subjects were wearing the firefighting
   gear; no change was observed without firefighting gear. Our results
   demonstrate that rapid heat stress and the resulting physiological
   stress cause a rapid increase in the rate of salivary cortisol
   appearance. Our results also support previous research demonstrating
   that cortisol is a sensitive strain metric of heat intolerance.},

Title = {Effects of semi-constant temperature on embryonic and hatchling
   phenotypes of six-tubercled Amazon River turtles, Podocnemis
   sextuberculata},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {108},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose: We evaluated how constant incubation temperatures affect
   life-history traits pre-hatching and post -hatching of the six-tubercled
   Amazon River turtle, Podocnemis sextuberculata. Methods: We incubated
   eggs from natural nests at ten semi-constant temperatures between 22.26
   +/- 1.01 degrees C and 37.37 +/- 0.38 degrees C (2013) and at six
   temperatures between 25.75 +/- 0.22 degrees C and 36.17 +/- 0.15 degrees
   C (2016). In 2013, we raised hatchling for 90 days to evaluate effects
   of temperature on early hatchling growth. We evaluated maternal effects
   in 2016.Results: P. sextuberculata displays temperature-dependent sex
   determination and produces males at colder and females at warmer
   temperatures (TSD Ia). The estimated pivotal temperature was 33.73 +/-
   0.15 degrees C and the transitional range of temperatures (TRT) 1.16 +/-
   0.59 degrees C. Semi-constant temperatures below 26 degrees C and above
   38 degrees C were lethal. Intermediate temperatures (32.25 degrees C and
   31.5 degrees C, respectively) were optimal for hatching success and
   produced larger hatchlings that grew slower early in life compared to
   colder or warmer conditions, which produced smaller hatchlings. Warmer
   incubation temperatures within the optimal range (28 degrees C-37
   degrees C) accelerated embryonic development. In contrast, comparisons
   of 30, 60 and 90 days-old suggests that warmer incubation temperatures
   reduced growth and mass gain rates post-hatching, such that incubation
   temperature effects on body size at emergence disappeared by 3 months of
   age.Conclusions: Six-tubercled Amazon River turtles showed the highest
   pivotal temperature reported for any turtle. The relatively narrow TRT
   may limit the evolutionary potential of this vulnerable turtle in the
   face of global warming. Future incubation experiments at a finer scale
   (33 degrees C-36 degrees C) are warranted to refine the sex-ratio
   re-action norm. Field studies that monitor natural nests are imperative
   to evaluate conservation measures and the effect of female-biased
   illegal hunting and climate change. By providing data about the thermal
   biology of an understudied lineage of non-model species, our study helps
   fill gaps in our understanding of the evolution of vertebrate sex
   determination and its potential adaptive value.},

Title = {Evaluation of body surface temperature variations in dogs affected by
   spinal cord injuries during physiotherapy exercise in a water treadmill},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The aim this study was to evaluate variation in body surface temperature
   (BST) in healthy and spinal cord injured (SCI) dogs, and to outline
   temperature variation at rest (T0), during (T1) and after (T2)
   water-treadmill physiotherapy sessions in SCI using infrared
   thermography (IRT). Sixty-seven dogs of different sex, breed, body
   weight and age were enrolled: 14 healthy dogs and 53 dogs affected by
   disc pathologies. The study examined three regions of interest (ROIs):
   the total image of the spine (IMAGE), the spinal cord area from 1st
   thoracic vertebra to the last lumbar vertebra (AR01) and the surgery
   wound or spinal cord lesion area (AR02). Significant BST variations
   between healthy and SCI were reported in T degrees max and T degrees
   max-min (Delta T) values in IMAGE (P < 0.05). In SCI group, AR01 and
   AR02 assessment showed an increase in temperature ate the sited of the
   injured area and adjacent body structures. In SCI, a significant effect
   of water-treadmill exercise in AR01 and AR02 was reported. In fact, both
   AR01 and AR02 reported higher BST (T degrees max, T degrees mean, T
   degrees min and Delta T) during the physical exercise (T1), representing
   the response to physical activity of the spine vascularization, muscles
   and column contiguous tissues. Furthermore, in T2, the same areas
   reported a significant lower BST (T degrees max, T degrees mean, and
   Delta T), related to a decrease in tissue inflammation on the target
   area of the water treadmill physiotherapy. This study highlights how IRT
   can detect BST variations associated with injured areas. In addition,
   IRT revealed a positive effect of water-treadmill exercise on the
   injured spinal cord areas, thus it could be a viable non-invasive and
   rapid method to support both clinical examination and assessment of the
   effectiveness of medical treatment in SCI.},

Title = {Temperature-dependent phenology of Campaea margaritaria (L)
   (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) derived from field data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A new phenology model, using thermal sums of triangulated daily
   temperatures, was applied to the derivation and validation of lower
   temperature threshold limit and thermal constants of bivoltine Campaea
   margaritaria (L) from 70 observed flight peak days in The Netherlands
   (period of 1986-2020) and daily ambient air temperatures of 10 weather
   stations. Development was assumed to be controlled directly by
   temperature for the summer generation. During fall a diapause of young
   larvae was assumed and confirmed. A lower threshold limit of TL = 6.70
   +/- 0.06 degrees C was found and a mean thermal winter and summer
   generation constant of K1,m = 838 +/- 9 and K2, m = 848 +/- 6 degrees
   C.day, respectively, for the reference period of 1993-2013. Generation
   differences could not be explained with temperature-size rules in
   ectotherm organisms. Threshold limit and thermal constants depended
   slightly on the period of derivation indicating short-term plasticity.
   Flight peak days were calculated with root mean square errors of 2.2-3.0
   days for both generations. Changing temperatures of the reference period
   led to temperature dependences of flight peak days of -6.4 and -8.7
   day/degrees C of the winter and summer generation, respectively.
   Neglecting physiological changes a complete third generation would
   require an increase of 3.7 degrees C, a single generation a decrease of
   4.1 degrees C.},

Title = {Thermal acclimation alters both basal heat shock protein gene expression
   and the heat shock response in juvenile lake whitefish (<i>Coregonus
   clupeaformis</i>)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {104},

Abstract = {Long-term temperature shifts associated with seasonal variability are
   common in temperate regions. However, these natural shifts could place
   significant strain on thermal stress responses of fishes when combined
   with mean increases in water temperatures predicted by climate change
   models. We examined the relationship between thermal acclimation, basal
   expression of heat shock protein (hsp) genes and the activation of the
   heat shock response (HSR) in lake whitefish (LWF; Coregonus
   clupeaformis), a cold water species of cultural and commercial
   significance. Juveniles were acclimated to either 6, 12, or 18 degrees C
   water for several months prior to the quantification of hsp mRNA levels
   in the presence or absence of acute heat shock (HS). Acclimation to 18
   degrees C increased basal mRNA levels of hsp70 and hsp47, but not hsc70
   or hsp90 beta in gill, liver and white muscle, while 6 degrees C
   acclimation had no effect on basal hsp transcription. Fish in all
   acclimation groups were capable of eliciting a robust HSR following
   acute HS, as indicated by the upregulation of hsp70 and hsp47. An
   increase of only 2 degrees C above the 18 degrees C acclimation
   temperature was required to trigger these transcriptional changes,
   suggesting that the HSR may be frequently initiated in LWF populations
   living at mildly elevated temperatures. Collectively, these expression
   profiles show that environmental temperature influences both basal hsp
   levels and the HSR in LWF, and indicate that these fish may have a
   greater physiological and ecological susceptibility to elevated
   temperatures than to cooler temperatures.},

Title = {Effects of Spirulina (<i>Arthrospira platensis</i>) as a drinking water
   supplement during cyclical chronic heat stress on broiler chickens:
   Assessing algal composition, production, stress, health and
   immune-biochemical indices},

Abstract = {Spirulina, the blue green algae is considered to exhibit multifaceted
   benefits on both human health and animal production. Three hundred sixty
   day old unsexed broiler chicks of CARIBROVISHAL strain were assigned to
   five treatment groups each comprising nine replicates of 8 chicks. The
   experiment was carried out during the hot humid summer season (Mid-April
   to May) under deep litter rearing system with uniform managemental
   conditions. Birds were administered orally with Spirulina through
   drinking water in the morning (06:00-12:00 PM) on daily basis throughout
   the experimental period at 5, 10, 15 and 20 gL(-1) concentration.
   Spirulina supplementation neither improved nor compromised production
   performance of broilers reared during hot climatic condition. Results
   based on one way analysis of variance indicated a significant effect on
   haemoglobin and total red blood cell count. Serum lipid content and
   transaminases were reduced, while serum protein concentration was higher
   (P < 0.01) in the groups administered with 15 and 20 gL(-1) of
   Spirulina. The extent of imparting shank pigmentation was improved in
   all the supplemented groups. Cell mediated and humoral immunity against
   Phytoheamagglutunin-P and Newcastle disease vaccination respectively
   were maximized (P < 0.05) at 20 gL(-1). These findings provide direct
   evidence of dose-related modulation of production, physiological and
   immunological attributes by Spirulina engendering its further
   investigation as a potential source of drinking water supplement for
   stress alleviation in broilers. From the results, it may concluded that
   Spirulina can be incorporated at 15 or 20 gL(-1) for achieving optimal
   improvement of health and welfare attributes in broilers reared during
   hot summer without compromising production.},

Title = {Inhibition of swarming motility using <i>in vitro</i> hyperthermia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {100},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Hyperthermia is a therapeutic technique in which body tissue is exposed
   to temperatures in the region of 40-45 degrees C to induce a
   physiological or biological effect. Swarming motility is an important
   virulence factor for Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
   swarming phenomenon is a coordinated multicellular move-ment of
   differentiated bacterial population over semi-solid surfaces. In this
   study, we aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of hyperthermia on
   bacterial swarming motility using a modified thermobiogram method and
   show the potential of this thermal method to treat bacterial infections.
   Ten P. mirabilis and 10 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates were included in
   the study. Sheep blood agar (SBA) plates were prepared and inoculated
   with bacterial suspensions of clinical isolates. Inoculated SBA plates
   were incubated inside 2 different incubators; at 37 degrees C and 45
   degrees C for 20 h. The diameter of bacterial growing zones (swarming
   diameters) were measured every 2 h and noted. Finally, Gram stains of
   the isolates were prepared for microscopic examination. Wilcoxon
   signed-rank test was used to compare the swarming inhibition rates of
   the isolates incubated at 37 degrees C and 45 degrees C. Regarding P.
   mirabilis species, a significant difference was found between two
   different temperatures (P = 0.0078). So, a temperature at the level of
   hyperthermia significantly inhibited the swarming motility of P.
   mirabilis isolates. In addition, transformation to coccus form was
   observed at 45 degrees C. We speculate that these findings might be
   useful for employing thermal therapies including hyperthermia method to
   treat infectious diseases caused by swarming bacterial pathogens in the
   future.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the thermoelastic responses of skin tissue during
   laser irradiation based on a generalized dual-phase-lag (DPL) model. The
   method of separation of variables is utilized to obtain the analytical
   solutions for thermal and mechanical responses. The influences of some
   crucial parameters on temperature, displacement and stress evolutions
   are discussed, including the phase lag of heat flux, the phase lag of
   temperature gradient and the phase lag of laser pulse, the coupling
   factor between tissue and blood, the porosity of tissue, the equivalent
   diameter of tissue and the diameter of blood vessels. The generalized
   DPL bio-heat transfer model predicts different results from those by the
   classical DPL model and Pennes model. The equivalent diameter of tissue
   affects the coupling factor between tissue and blood, while the diameter
   of blood vessels mainly affects the porosity of tissue.},

Title = {Effects of recent thermal history on thermal behaviour, thermal
   tolerance and oxygen uptake of Yellowtail Kingfish (<i>Seriola
   lalandi</i>) juveniles},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {This study determined the physiological and metabolic responses of
   cultivated Yellowtail Kingfish (Seriola lalandi) juveniles in accordance
   with their recent thermal history. The fish were acclimated at 20, 23,
   26, 29 and 32 degrees C for 21 days to determine the final preferred
   temperature, thermal tolerance and the effect of acclimation
   temperatures on their oxygen uptake and aerobic scope. The final
   preferred temperature of juveniles was established at 26 degrees C. The
   critical thermal maximum (CTmax) ranged from 34.2 to 36.9 degrees C,
   while the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) ranged from 10.9 to 17.3
   degrees C, depending on acclimation temperature. With the CTmax and
   CTmin values, the thermal window was determined to have an area of 258
   degrees C-2, which is characteristic of subtropical organisms. Although,
   the metabolic rate was relatively constant (ranging 390.6-449.8 mg O-2
   kg(-0.8)h(-1)) between 20 and 26 degrees C (Q(10) = 1.6, 1.0), an
   increase to 544.8 mg O-2 kg(-0.8)h(-1) at 29 degrees C (Q(10) = 1.9) and
   decrease of 478.4 mg O-2 kg(-0.8)h(-1) at 32 degrees C (Q10 = 0.6) were
   observed. The maximum value obtained for aerobic scope was 310.9 mg O-2
   kg(-0.8)h(-1) degrees C. These results suggest that the acclimation
   temperature of 26 degrees C is an optimum thermal condition for a
   physiological and metabolic performance of yellowtail kingfish
   juveniles. On the contrary, the response observed during the evaluation
   of critical temperatures, oxygen uptake and aerobic scope indicated that
   yellowtail kingfish in the juvenile state could be vulnerable when it
   experiences for long periods (e.g., >21 days) temperatures above 29
   degrees C. According to our results, the thermoregulatory behaviour of
   yellowtail kingfish in the juvenile stages could be one of the most
   important mechanisms to maintain its optimal physiological performance
   by actively selecting a stable thermal environment close to 26 degrees
   C. In addition, it was determined the limits of the pejus state of
   juvenile yellowtail kingfish at 29 degrees C, where an increase of
   oxygen uptake to maintain the aerobic energy metabolism was observed,
   this could certainly affect the growth of juveniles in culture systems
   if they do not return in a thermal range of 23-26 degrees C. These
   results can contribute to infer the different effects of acclimation
   temperature on the growth, thermal tolerance and respiratory capacity of
   S. lalandi juveniles on aquaculture systems.},

Title = {Performance of roof-mounted misting fans to regulate heat stress in
   dairy cows},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {99},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Heat stress can negatively affect cow's physiology, behavior, and milk
   production. This study evaluates the effectiveness of roof mounting
   misting fans to improve heat and humidity index which reduces heat
   stress in a cowshed. Local climatic conditions were monitored and
   cooling system ability to control heat stress were assessed.
   Measurements were conducted at different cooling zones and levels
   comparing with shaded and open zones. The temperature and humidity index
   measurements outside the cowshed THIout showed that animals exposed to
   high degrees of heat stress during most of the day. The average value of
   THIout was 87.49, whereas the average value of adjusted outside
   temperature and humidity index THIadj was greater than THIout by 10\%
   when solar radiation was considered. The maximum difference of hourly
   averages for temperature and humidity indices THIadj and THI occurred at
   noon when the intensity of solar radiation was highest. The average
   value for temperature and humidity index under misting fans THIfan was
   82.27 whereas inside the cowshed under shade THIshade was 85.20. This
   conclude that the misting fans was able to reduce heat stress in a
   limited degree. Further improvement in terms of the cowshed design
   aspects and an increase of cooling efficiency is needed.},

Title = {Brook Trout<i> (Salvelinus</i><i> fontinalis)</i> and Brown Trout<i>
   (Salmo</i><i> trutta)</i> summer thermal habitat use in streams with
   sympatric populations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {98},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study addresses the need to examine the thermally mediated
   interactions of fish with their natural environment by investigating the
   shift in thermal habitat occupation for sympatric Brook and Brown Trout
   populations. We observed upstream Brook Trout and Brown Trout population
   shifts during the summer, with thermal habitats showing an increased
   number of Brown Trout, while some sites also displayed a decrease in the
   number of Brook Trout. Overall, there was an increased incidence of
   overlapping habitat occupation at the end of the summer. Brown Trout
   occupied optimal resting and feeding thermal habitat locations, which
   can potentially affect growth rates and Brook Trout's survival.
   Population shifts did not occur at elevated water temperatures as
   expected but seem driven by temperatures that are optimal for growth.
   Observed population shifts can lead to increased interactions between
   the two species throughout the summer. The results provide a better
   understanding of how future, longer-term, thermal habitat modifications
   may modify species interactions, which are critical for salmonid
   conservation efforts.},

Title = {When insect pests build their own thermal niche: The hot nest of the
   pine processionary moth},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {98},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Temperature strongly drives physiological and ecological processes in
   ectotherms. While many species rely on behavioural thermoregulation to
   avoid thermal extremes, others build structures (nests) that confer a
   shelter against climate variability and extremes. However, the
   microclimate inside nests remains unknown for most insects. We
   investigated the thermal environment inside the nest of a temperate
   winter-developing insect species, the pine processionary moth (PPM),
   Thaumetopoea pityocampa. Gregarious larvae collectively build a silken
   nest at the beginning of the cold season. We tested the hypothesis that
   it provides a warmer microenvironment to larvae. First, we monitored
   temperature inside different types of nests varying in the number of
   larvae inside. Overall, nest temperature was positively correlated to
   global radiation and air temperature. At noon, when global radiation was
   maximal, nest temperature exceeded air temperature by up to 11.2-16.5
   degrees C depending on nest type. In addition, thermal gradients of
   amplitude from 6.85 to 15.5 degrees C were observed within nests, the
   upper part being the warmest. Second, we developed a biophysical model
   to predict temperature inside PPM nests based on heat transfer equations
   and to explain this important temperature excess. A simple model version
   accurately predicted experimental measurements, confirming that nest
   temperature is driven mainly by radiation load. Finally, the model
   showed that nest temperature increases at the same rate as air
   temperature change. We conclude that some pest insects already live in
   warm microclimates by building their own sheltering nest. This effect
   should be considered when studying the impact of climate change on
   phenology and distribution.},

Abstract = {The human blood plasma proteome profile has been an area of intensive
   investigation and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has come
   forward as a novel tool in analyzing plasma heat capacity changes to
   monitor various physiological responses in health and disease. This
   study used DSC to assess potential alterations in the plasma heat
   capacity profile of albumin and globulins during extremely demanding
   physical exercise. We monitored the changes in denaturation profiles of
   those plasma proteins for five consecutive days of an extraordinary
   exercise training schedule in 14 young male Special Forces volunteers,
   as well as after a 30-day recovery period. The major effect of the
   prolonged intense exercise was the continuous upward shift of the
   albumin peak by 2??3 ?C on the initial days of exercise, with a tendency
   to plateau circa the 5th day of exercise. In addition, some
   redistribution of the denaturational enthalpy was observed upon
   exercise, where the globulins peak increased relative to the albumin
   peak. Noteworthy, the alterations in the plasma proteome denaturational
   profiles were not persistent, as virtually full recovery of the initial
   status was observed after 30 days of recovery. Our findings indicate
   that 5 days of exhaustive physical exercise of highly trained
   individuals enhanced the thermal stability of plasma albumin shifting
   its denaturational transition to higher temperatures. We surmise that
   these effects may be a result of increased blood oxygenation during the
   prolonged intense exercise and, consequently, of albumin oxidation as
   part of the overall adaptation mechanisms of the body to extreme
   physical and/ or oxidative stress.},

Title = {Elevated ambient temperature accelerates aspects of torpor phenology in
   an obligate hibernator},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {96},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) is
   assumed to be an obligate hibernator - commencing and terminating
   hibernation on a circannual rhythm, regardless of environmental
   conditions - but, until now, this assumption had never been fully
   tested. We housed three groups of captive-born ground squirrels from
   Aug. 2017 to Aug. 2018 under constant photoperiod (12 h L:12 h D) at 5,
   16 or 25 degrees C, and monitored hibernation using body temperature
   loggers. At 5 and 16 degrees C all animals hibernated from autumn to
   spring with no differences in date of first/last torpor or duration of
   interbout euthermic periods (IBE), but torpor bout duration was 25\%
   shorter at 16 degrees C. One of 4 animals housed at 25 degrees C did not
   hibernate. For the other three 25 degrees C animals, the first torpor
   date did not differ from the other groups, but the last torpor bout (5
   Feb.) occurred almost 8 weeks earlier. These animals aroused from torpor
   more frequently and IBE lasted significantly longer, so the total time
   spent torpid was less than 50\% of the other groups. Unlike the 5 or 16
   degrees C animals, 25 degrees C animals reentered torpor in late spring
   2018. Taken together these data suggest that this species is an obligate
   hibernator, but that high ambient temperatures can accelerate the
   endogenous circannual hibernation rhythm.},

Title = {Microhabitats choice in intertidal gastropods is species-, temperature-
   and habitat-specific},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {94},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding how behavioural adaptations can limit thermal stress for
   intertidal gastropods will be crucial for climate models. Some
   behavioural adaptations are already known to limit desiccation and
   thermal stresses as shell-lifting, shell-standing, towering, aggregation
   of conspecifics or habitat selection. Here we used the IRT (i.e.
   infrared thermography) to investigate the thermal heterogeneity of a
   rocky platform, with four different macrohabitats (i.e. bare rock, rock
   with barnacles, mussels and mussels incrusted by barnacles) over four
   thermally contrasted months. We investigated the body temperature of
   Littorina littorea and Patella vulgata found on this platform and the
   temperature of their microhabitat (i.e. the substratum within one body
   length around of each individual). We also considered the aggregation
   behaviour of each species and assessed the percentage of thermal
   microhabitat choice (i.e choice for a microhabitat with a temperature
   different than the surrounding substrate). We did not find any
   aggregation of L. littorea on the rocky platform during the four studied
   months. In contrast, P. vulgata were found in aggregates in all the
   studied periods and within each habitat, but there was no difference in
   body temperature between aggregated and solitary individuals. These two
   gastropods species were preferentially found on rock covered by
   barnacles in the four studied months. The presence of a thermal
   microhabitat choice in L. littorea and P. vulgata is habitat-dependent
   and also season-dependent. In June, July and November the choice was for
   a microhabitat with temperatures lower than the temperatures of the
   surrounding substrate whereas in December, individuals choose
   microhabitats with higher temperatures than the temperatures of their
   substratum. Taken together, these results suggest that gastropods
   species are able to explore their environment to find sustainable
   thermal macrohabitats and microhabitats and adapt this behaviour in
   function of the conditions of temperatures.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Pseudocoloring algorithms embedded in the software of thermal cameras
   gradually colorize original intensity thermograms generated by detecting
   temperatures and contrast. Maximum and minimum based algorithms,
   however, executed by thresholding, applied to intensity thermograms for
   revealing and coloring the outliers instead. Although the common
   pseudocoloring protocols employed for general purposes may provide
   crucial information on the superficial contrast between radiation
   emitted by various sources; their common kernel is not sufficient for
   detecting and differentiating high radiated regions from surrounding
   areas, which is mandatory for recognition of abnormalities. Therefore,
   we propose novel imaging methodology based on Nakagami and related
   distributions, including gamma, Rayleigh, Weibull, chi-square and
   exponential, for enhancing thermal images and also for creating adequate
   discrimination. We initially define the boundaries of tumor and
   surrounding area in a synthetically generated breast thermogram already
   diagnosed as retroareolar tumor. Using Nakagami and transformations
   supported by mathematical foundations, we conducted several experiments
   to find the discrimination factor of the pseudocoloring techniques by
   calculating difference of average contrast between the tumor and the
   surrounding area. The performance is greatly encouraging that we
   achieved considerably better discrimination factor, designated for this
   study, up to 106.80 compared to the results of existing built-in
   pseudocolorization methods computed as 11.56.},

Title = {Thermal physiology explains the elevational range for a lizard,
   <i>Eutropis longicaudata</i>, in Taiwan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {93},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {1: The decrease of temperatures along an elevation gradient imposes
   physiological constraints on reptiles that ultimately determine their
   distribution ranges. Forest patterns are likely to interact with this
   process, but very few studies have examined their contribution in
   determining distribution limits.
   2: We examined the role played by thermal physiology and forest cover in
   determining the elevational ranges of a lizard, Eutropis longicaudata.
   We integrated this species' thermal traits in simulating its maximum
   activity time under different conditions of forest cover and elevation
   using a NicheMapR model. In addition, we evaluated the influence of
   winter temperatures on the range limit by examining the simulated soil
   temperatures at the occurrence sites.
   3: Laboratory experiments showed that E. longicaudata has a high
   preferred body temperature and low cold tolerance. The model predicts
   that maximum activity time decreases with elevation and forest cover.
   Although unforested areas may provide longer active time in all
   simulated elevations, mountain areas in Taiwan are heavily forested and
   are predicted to allow only a very short period of activity above 1000 m
   elevation.
   4: All sightings were indeed located in areas below 1000 m elevation, in
   which the predicted average soil temperature is above 10 degrees C in
   January in cold years.
   5: Our results show that reptile physiological response does respond
   strongly to the change of microclimate induced by forest cover and
   elevation. Overall, this suggests that forest cover is a major
   determinant of some reptiles' elevational range.},

Abstract = {Agroforestry systems can minimize heat stress and improve cattle
   welfare, but the influence of the forest component in micmclimatic
   changes in the southern Amazon remains unclear. This study aimed to
   compare the thermal comfort indices in grass monoculture and integrated
   systems. The three systems were pasture under full sunlight (PFS),
   integrated (triple-row) livestock-forestry (ILFT), and integrated
   (single-row) livestock-forestry (ILFs), across four seasons, for two
   years, from June 2017 to June 2019. We assessed photosynthetically
   active radiation (PAR), air temperature, relative humidity, black globe
   temperature, and wind speed. Thermal comfort indices such as
   temperature-humidity index (THI), black globe temperature-humidity index
   (BGHI), and radiant thermal load (RTL) were calculated based on
   microclimate data daily-collected from 8:00 to 16:00. The ILFT mean THI
   (76.8) was slightly lower than ILFS and PFS. The BGHI and RTL values
   decreased as shading increased (PFS > ILFs > ILFT). The most challenging
   heat stress conditions for grazing animals occurred predominately during
   winter and autumn. In conclusion, the presence of trees in pastures of
   the southern Amazon improved the microclimate and, consequently, the
   thermal comfort indices. Agroforestry systems can foster an environment
   with a more suitable thermal comfort or less restrictive to animal
   performance, which contribute to mitigating global climate change for
   forage-livestock systems in Brazilian Amazon.},

Title = {A canine thermal model for simulating temperature responses of military
   working dogs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {91},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Military working dogs (MWDs) are often required to operate in dangerous
   or extreme environments, to include hot and humid climate conditions.
   These scenarios can put MWD at significant risk of heat injury. To
   address this concern, a two-compartment (core, skin) rational
   thermophysiological model was developed to predict the temperature of a
   MWD during rest, exercise, and recovery. The Canine Thermal Model (CTM)
   uses inputs of MWD mass and length to determine a basal metabolic rate
   and body surface area. These calculations are used along with time
   series inputs of environmental conditions (air temperature, relative
   humidity, solar radiation and wind velocity) and level of metabolic
   intensity (MET) to predict MWD thermoregulatory responses. Default
   initial values of core and skin temperatures are set at neutral values
   representative of an average MWD; however, these can be adjusted to
   match known or expected individual temperatures. The rational principles
   of the CTM describe the heat exchange from the metabolic energy of the
   core compartment to the skin compartment by passive conduction as well
   as the application of an active control for skin blood flow and to
   tongue and lingual tissues. The CTM also mathematically describes heat
   loss directly to the environment via respiration, including panting.
   Thermal insulation properties of MWD fur are also used to influence heat
   loss from skin and gain from the environment. This paper describes the
   CTM in detail, outlining the equations used to calculate avenues of heat
   transfer (convective, conductive, radiative and evaporative), overall
   heat storage, and predicted responses of the MWD. Additionally, this
   paper outlines examples of how the CTM can be used to predict recovery
   from exertional heat strain, plan work/rest cycles, and estimate work
   duration to avoid overheating.},

Abstract = {The aim of this work was to evaluate the thermal comfort of sows in a
   free-range system in the Brazilian Savanna, based on behavior
   observation, availability of shading resources, meteorological and
   physiological variables. The sows were analyzed in the gestation sector
   at Agua Limpa Farm from University of Brasilia; the sows were housed in
   paddocks of 1000 m(2) each containing artificial and natural shading
   structures, where air temperature (T-air, degrees C), wind speed,
   relative humidity (R-H, \%) and black globe temperatures (T-G, degrees
   C) were collected for the environment characterization in
   20-min-intervals. From the black globe temperature, the Mean Radiant
   Temperature (T-MR, degrees C) and the Radiant Heat Load (R-HL, W m(-2))
   were calculated in the sun and under the shade structures. The total
   short-wave irradiance was calculated through the sum of direct, diffuse
   and reflected radiations. For the behavioral evaluation, an ethogram was
   elaborated, taking in consideration where the animals were in the
   paddocks, body posture, and the activity performed. The physiological
   variables such as respiratory rate (breaths.min(-1)), surface and rectal
   temperatures (degrees C) were measured during the experiment. The data
   was statistically analyzed through analysis of variance and frequency
   analysis. There was a difference at 11a.m., 2 and 3p.m., with values
   above 40 degrees C under the shade and above 70 degrees C in the sun for
   the T-MR. The preferential choice was for natural shading by the sows,
   due to the lower T-MR and R-HL throughout the day and resting activity
   had been predominated. The rectal temperature did not differ between the
   animals and the days evaluated, respiratory rate varied according to air
   temperature, and surface temperature only among the evaluated animals.
   It was concluded that even when there is a greater radiation incidence
   and meteorological variables above the condition of comfort for sows,
   they did not express any abnormal behavior that could indicate
   discomfort.},

Title = {Does oxidative stress determine the thermal limits of the regeneration
   niche of <i>Vriesea friburgensis</i> and <i>Alcantarea imperialis</i>
   (Bromeliaceae) seedlings?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The predicted environmental changes may be detrimental to initial
   seedling growth, particularly the expected increase in air temperature.
   We therefore investigated the thermal limits for growth and development
   of Vriesea friburgensis and Alcantarea imperialis seedlings in the
   context of oxidative stress. The optimal temperatures for the growth of
   V. friburgensis and A. imperialis were 25 and 25-30 degrees C,
   respectively. Extreme temperatures (15, 30, or 35 degrees C) induced
   oxidative stress in both species with significant accumulation of
   hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO). Under oxidative stress,
   the amount of chlorophyll decreased in both species, more prominently in
   V. friburgensis, while carotenoid levels dramatically increased in A.
   imperialis. Notably, the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase
   (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase increased in A. imperialis at extreme
   temperatures. Similar results were observed for V. friburgensis;
   however, the activity of CAT remained unaffected regardless of
   temperature. Seedlings of A. imperialis survived at a wider range of
   temperatures than V. friburgensis, which had greater than 40\% mortality
   when growing at 30 degrees C. Overall, precise control of cellular H2O2
   and NO levels takes place during the establishment of A. imperialis
   seedlings, allowing the species to cope with relatively high
   temperatures. The thermal limits of the fundamental niches of the
   species investigated, determined based on the ability of seedlings to
   cope with oxidative stress, were distinct from the realized niches of
   these species. The results suggest that recruitment success is dependent
   on the ability of seedlings to handle extreme temperature-triggered
   oxidative stress, which limits the regeneration niche.},

   and their relevance to ants},

Abstract = {Small, cursorial ectotherms like ants often are immersed in the
   superheated air layers that develop millimeters above exposed, insolated
   surfaces (i.e., the thermal boundary layer). We quantified the thermal
   microenvironments around tree branches in the tropical rainforest
   canopy, and explored the effects of substrate color on the internal body
   temperature and species composition of arboreal ants. Branch
   temperatures during the day (09:00-16:00) were hottest (often > 50
   degrees C) and most variable on the upper surface, while the lowest and
   least variable temperatures occurred on the underside. Temperatures on
   black substrates declined with increasing distance above the surface in
   both the field and the laboratory. By contrast, a micro-scale
   temperature inversion occurred above white substrates. Wind events (ca.
   2 m s(-1)) eliminated these patterns. Internal temperatures of bodies of
   Cephalotes atratus workers experimentally heated in the laboratory were
   6 degrees C wanner on white vs. black substrates, and 6 degrees C cooler
   than ambient in windy conditions. The composition of ant species
   foraging at baits differed between black-painted and unpainted tree
   branches, with a tendency for smaller ants to avoid the significantly
   hotter black surfaces. Collectively, these outcomes show that ants
   traversing canopy branches experience very heterogeneous thermal
   microenvironments that are partly influenced in predictable ways by
   branch surface coloration and breezy conditions.},

Title = {Physical mechanism or evolutionary trade-off? Factors dictating the
   relationship between metabolic rate and ambient temperature in carabid
   beetles},

Abstract = {The tight association between ambient temperature (T) and metabolic rate
   (MR) is a common occurrence in ectotherms, but the determinants of this
   association are not fully understood. This study examined whether the
   relationship between MR and T is the same among individuals, as
   predicted by the Universal Temperature Dependence hypothesis, or whether
   this relationship differs between them. We used flow-through
   respirometry to measure standard MR and to determine gas exchange
   patterns for 111 individuals of three Carabidae species which differ in
   size (Abax ovalis, Carabus linnei and C. coriaceus), exposed to four
   different temperatures (ten individuals of each species measured at 6,
   11, 16 and 21 degrees C). We found a significant interaction between In
   body mass and the inverse of temperature, indicating that in a given
   species, the effect of temperature on MR was weaker in larger
   individuals than in smaller individuals. Overall, this finding shows
   that the thermal dependence of MR is not body mass invariant. We
   observed three types of gas exchange patterns among beetles:
   discontinuous, cyclic and continuous. Additionally, the appearance of
   these patterns was associated with MR and T. Evolution in diverse
   terrestrial environments could affect diverse ventilation patterns,
   which accommodate changes in metabolism in response to temperature
   variation. In conclusion, explaining the variance in metabolism only
   through fundamental physical laws of thermodynamics, as predicted by the
   Universal Temperature Dependence hypothesis, appears to oversimplify the
   complexity of nature, ignoring evolutionary trade-offs that should be
   taken into account in the temperature metabolism relationship.},

Abstract = {Thermal tolerance is important in determining the spatial and temporal
   distributions of insects but the mechanisms which determine upper
   thermal limits remain poorly understood. In terrestrial insects heat
   tolerance is unlikely to be limited by oxygen supply but in some
   arthropods, heat stress has been shown to cause haemolymph hyperkalaemia
   which is known to have detrimental effects on neuromuscular
   excitability. It is however unresolved if heat-induced hyperkalemia is
   the cause or the result of cellular heat injury. To address the putative
   role of heat-induced hyperkalemia we quantified changes in ion and water
   balance in haemolymph and muscle tissue of the migratory locust during
   exposure to two static temperatures clustered around the CTmax (48
   degrees C and 50 degrees C). We show that heat stress caused a loss of
   ion balance and severe haemolymph hyperkalaemia which coincided with the
   onset of heat stupor. Locusts were able to maintain their haemolymph
   volume throughout exposure, suggesting it is unlikely that
   osmoregulatory failure is responsible for haemolymph hyperkalaemia. When
   locusts were allowed to recover from heat stupor, they recovered ion
   balance quickly but were still unable to function optimally after 24 h.
   The results therefore indicate that both the haemolymph hyperkalaemia
   and associated depression of muscular function (heat stupor) are
   secondary results of cellular heat injury and that the cause of heat
   stupor most be sought elsewhere.},

Title = {Effect of thermal exposure on physiological adaptability and seminal

Abstract = {Thermal stress in hot semi-arid environment is a major limitation of
   sheep production in tropical and subtropical climatic condition. The
   animals tend to maintain homeostasis through physiological adjustments
   in a hot environment (maximum temperature reaches up to 47.5 degrees C).
   Therefore, the present study was carried out to assess the effect of
   thermal exposure on physiological adaptability and seminal attributes of
   rams under semi-arid environment. The experiment was conducted for eight
   weeks involving sixteen Malpura crossbred rams (GMM: Garole X Malpura X
   Malpura). The rams were divided equally into two groups, designated as
   GI and G2, respectively. The rams in GI (Control) group were kept in a
   sheep shed under naturally prevailing environment without artificial
   manipulation of ambient temperature (Temperature 30.48 +/- 0.38 degrees
   C; Relative Humidity 28.59 +/- 1.15\%). The rams of G2 group were
   exposed to different temperature at different hours of the day (38
   degrees C at 1000-1100 h; 40 degrees C at 1100-1200 h; 42 degrees C at
   12:00-1300 h; 43 degrees C at 1300-1400 h; 44 degrees C at 1400-1500 h
   and 42 degrees C at 1500-1600 h) in a climatic chamber for thermal
   exposure. Physiological responses, blood biochemical profile, blood
   endocrine profile, sexual behavior and seminal attributes were measured
   for both the groups. Thermal exposure significantly (P <0.05) increased
   the water intake; respiration rate, rectal temperature and skin
   temperature at afternoon in rams. Exposure of rams to thermal stress
   (G2) significantly (P < 0.05) increased cortisol level and decreased
   tri-ido-thyronine level. The latency period after the first ejaculation,
   decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in G2. The percentage of rapid motile
   sperm, linearity and average path velocity of sperm were also altered
   significantly (P < 0.05) in thermal exposed rams as compared to control.
   However, comparable feed intake, body weight, and major blood
   biochemical parameters, as well as acceptable semen quality attributes
   of all the rams indicated that the Fec B gene introgressed Malpura cross
   rams adapted to the thermal exposure under semi -arid tropical climate.},

Abstract = {This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the differences in abdominal
   temperature (AT) between fertile (n=206; age) and infertile (n=250)
   women between the ages of 30 and 39 years. We evaluated the differences
   in two distinctive skin temperatures by thermography: Delta T-1 (CV8
   index) - difference in temperature between the mid-abdomen (CV8
   acupuncture area) and ventral upper arm (VUA) and Delta T-2 (CV4 index)
   - difference in temperature between the lower abdomen (CV4 acupuncture
   area) and VUA. The results indicated that the Delta T-1 and Delta T-2 of
   infertile women were significantly lower (by 1.05 degrees C and 0.79
   degrees C, respectively; p < 0.001, both) compared to those of fertile
   women. Additionally, the area under the curve of Delta T-1 (0.78) was
   greater compared to that of Delta T-2 (0.736), and its threshold was set
   at 0.675 degrees C, by which, the sensitivity and specificity of Delta
   T-1 for determination of fertility were found to be 80.8\% and 68.4\%,
   respectively. In conclusion, infertility is associated with lower AT.
   The decrease in AT in infertile women might be due to poor blood
   perfusion to the core muscles and tissues of the body. These findings
   provide a basis for further research for evaluation of clinical
   feasibility of thermography for analysis of infertility in women.
   Further evaluation of the influence of AT on fertility outcomes is
   required to determine the causal relationship between AT and
   infertility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The peak of thermoregulation effectiveness: Thermal biology of the
   Pyrenean rock lizard, <i>Iberolacerta bonnali</i> (Squamata, Lacertidae)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {77-83},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We studied, at 2200 m altitude, the thermal biology of the Pyrenean rock
   lizard, lberolacerta bonnali, in the glacial cirque of Cotatuero
   (National Park of Ordesa, Huesca, Spain). The preferred thermal range
   (PTR) of I. bonnali indicates that it is a cold-adapted ectotherm with a
   narrow PTR (29.20-32.77 degrees C). However, its PTR (3.57 degrees C) is
   twice as wide as other lberolacerta lizards, which may be explained by
   its broader historical distribution. The studied area is formed by a
   mosaic of microhabitats which offer different operative temperatures, so
   that lizards have, throughout their entire daily period of activity, the
   opportunity to choose the most thermally suitable substrates. I bonnali
   achieves an effectiveness of thermoregulation of 0.95, which makes it
   the highest value found to date among the Lacertidae, and one of the
   highest among lizards. Their relatively wide distribution, their wider
   PTR, and their excellent ability of thermoregulation, would make I.
   bonnali lizards less vulnerable to climate change than other species of
   lberolacerta. Thanks to its difficult access, the studied area is not
   visited by a large number of tourists, as are other areas of the
   National Park. Thus, it is a key area for the conservation of the
   Pyrenean rock lizard. By shuttling between suitable microhabitats,
   lizards achieve suitable body temperatures during all day. However, such
   thermally suitable microhabitats should vary in other traits than
   thermal quality, such as prey availability or predation risk. Hence, it
   seems that these not-thermal traits are not constraining habitat
   selection and thermoregulation in this population. Therefore, future
   research in this population may study the causes that would lead lizards
   to prioritize thermoregulation to such extent in this population. (C)

Title = {Thermal dependence of sprint performance in the lizard <i>Psammo-dromus

   lizards do not perform better at low temperatures},

Abstract = {Sprint speed has a capital relevance in most animals' fitness, mainly
   for fleeing from predators. Sprint performance is maximal within a
   certain range of body temperatures in ectotherms, whose thermal upkeep
   relies on exogenous thermal sources. Ectotherms can respond to diverse
   thermal environments either by shifting their thermal preferences or
   maintaining them through different adaptive mechanisms. Here, we tested
   whether maximum sprint speed of a lizard that shows conservative thermal
   ecology along a 2200-meter elevational gradient differs with body
   temperature in lizards from different elevations. Lizards ran faster at
   optimum than at suboptimum body temperature. Notably, high-elevation
   lizards were not faster than mid- and low-elevation lizards at
   suboptimum body temperature, despite their low-quality thermal
   environment. This result suggests that both preferred body temperature
   and thermal dependence of speed performance are co-adapted along the
   elevational gradient. High-elevation lizards display a number of
   thermoregulatory strategies that allow them to achieve high optimum body
   temperatures in a low thermal-quality habitat and thus maximize speed
   performance. As for reproductive condition, we did not find any effect
   of it on sprint speed, or any significant interaction with elevation or
   body temperature. However, strikingly, gravid females were significantly
   slower than males and non-gravid females at suboptimum temperature, but
   performed similarly well at optimal temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Effect of warming rate on the critical thermal maxima of crabs, shrimp
   and fish},

Abstract = {The threat of global warming has prompted numerous recent studies on the
   thermal tolerance of marine species. A widely used method to determine
   the upper thermal limit has been the Critical Thermal Maximum (CTMax), a
   dynamic method, meaning that temperature is increased gradually until a
   critical point is reached. This method presents several advantages over
   static methods, however, there is one main issue that hinders
   interpretation and comparison of CTMax results: the rate at which the
   temperature is increased. This rate varies widely among published
   protocols. The aim of the present work was to determine the effect of
   warming rate on CTMax values, using different animal groups. The
   influence of the thermal niche occupied by each species (intertidal vs
   subtidal) and habitat (intertidal vs subtidal) was also investigated.
   CTMax were estimated at three different rates: 1 degrees C min(-1),1
   degrees C 30 min(-1) and 1 degrees C h(-1), in two species of crab,
   Eurypanopeus abbreviatus and Menippe nodifrons, shrimp Palaemon
   northropi and Hippolyte obliquimanus and fish Bathygobius soporator and
   Parablennius marmoreus. While there were significant differences in the
   effect of warming rates for some species, for other species warming rate
   produced no significant differences (H. obliquimanus and B. soporator).
   While in some species slower warming rates lead to lower CTMax values
   (P. northropi and P. marmoreus) in other species the opposite occurred
   (E. abbreviatus and M. nodifrons). Biological group has a significant
   effect with crabs' CTMax increasing at slower warming rates, which did
   not happen for shrimp and fish. Subtidal species presented lower CTMax,
   at all warming rates tested. This study highlights the importance of
   estimating CTMax values at realistic rates that species encounter in
   their environment and thus have an ecological value. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {Predicted future increases in global temperature may impose challenges
   for ectothermic animals like fish, but the physiological mechanisms
   determining the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) are not well
   understood. One hypothesis suggests that impaired cardiac performance,
   limited by oxygen supply, is an important underlying mechanism. Since
   vagal bradycardia is suggested to improve cardiac oxygenation and
   adrenergic stimulation may improve cardiac contractility and protect
   cardiac function at high temperatures, we predicted that pharmacological
   blockade of cardiac autonomic control would lower CTmax. Rainbow trout
   was instrumented with a flow probe and a ventilation catheter for
   cardioventilatory recordings and exposed to an acute thermal challenge
   until CTmax following selective pharmacological blockade of muscarinic
   or beta-adrenergic receptors.
   Contrary to our prediction, CTmax (similar to 26 degrees C) was
   unchanged between treatments. While beta-adrenergic blockade reduced
   heart rate it did not impair cardiac stroke volume across temperatures
   suggesting that compensatory increases in cardiac filling pressure may
   serve to maintain cardiac output. While warming resulted in significant
   tachycardia and increased cardiac output, a high cholinergic tone on the
   heart was observed at temperatures approaching CTmax. This may represent
   a mechanism to maintain scope for heart rate and possibly to improve
   myocardial contractility and oxygen supply at high temperatures. This is
   the first study evaluating the importance of autonomic cardiac control
   on thermal tolerance in fish. While no effects on CTmax were observed,
   this study raises important questions about the underlying mechanisms
   determining thermal tolerance limits in ectothermic animals. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Ambient temperature is an ubiquitous environmental factor affecting all
   organisms. Global climate change increases temperature variation and the
   frequency of extreme temperatures, which may pose challenges to
   ectotherms. Here, we examine phenotypic plasticity to temperature and
   genotypic effects on thermal tolerance in the Glanville fritillary
   butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). We found no significant difference in heat
   or cold tolerance in populations originating from a continental climate
   in China and from Finland with moderate temperature variation.
   Acclimation to large-amplitude temperature variation increased heat
   tolerance in both populations, but decreased cold tolerance and
   increased hsp70-2 expression in the Chinese population only. The latter
   result indicates a genotypic effect in the response to temperature
   variation. In the Finnish population, a non-synonymous SNP in the
   phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) gene was associated with heat knock-down
   time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To investigate early events possibly related to the development of heat
   shock, we examined whether inflammatory-(interleukin-6, tumor necrosis
   factor alpha and 15-keto-13,14-dihydro-PGF(2 alpha)) and
   peroxidative-(8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) and malondialdehyde) markers are
   altered during acute heat exposure and aging. We also studied the
   relationships between inflammatory and peroxidative markers in these
   settings. In order to prevent these reactions developed as a consequence
   of the conditions mentioned above, we tested the effects of
   alpha-tocopherol. Our results demonstrated that
   15-keto-13,14-dihydro-PGF2(alpha) and malondialdehyde in the liver were
   altered during acute heat exposure in The young and middle-aged rats and
   could be predicted by changes in the levels of circulatory cytokines.
   Regardless of age, the supplementation with alpha-tocopherol prevented
   changes in the plasma cytokine levels and 15-keto-13,14-dihydro-PGF(2
   alpha) and malondialdehyde levels in the liver, during acute heat
   exposure. This study notably emphasized the ability of a-tocopherol to
   prevent different heat induced mechanisms, involved in induction of
   inflammatory or peroxidative reactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Thermal habitat use and growth in young-of-the-year Arctic charr from
   proximal fluvial and lacustrine populations in Labrador, Canada},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Predicted increases in temperature associated with climate change are
   expected to have consequences for fish, in particular for Arctic charr,
   Salvelinus alpinus, a cold-adapted fish species. Despite differences in
   predicted hydroecological responses to climate change in fluvial and
   lacustrine environments, little is known of whether fluvial and
   lacustrine Arctic charr populations may respond differently to
   increasing temperatures. In order to compare growth and thermal habitat
   use between habitat types, otolith-inferred average water temperatures
   estimated from whole otoliths and fork lengths at capture were measured
   for young-of-the-year (YOY) Arctic charr obtained from two proximal
   fluvial and lacustrine sites in Labrador, Canada. Otolith-inferred
   average experienced water temperatures were not significantly correlated
   with air temperatures at both sites, suggestive of behavioural
   thermoregulation by YOY. The majority of Kogluktokoluk Brook (fluvial)
   YOY were found using water temperatures consistent with laboratory
   determined preferred temperatures for juvenile Arctic charr, whereas
   most Tom's Pond (lacustrine) YOY were found using temperatures ranging
   between preferred temperatures and optimal temperatures for growth.
   There was no consistent difference between mean water temperatures used
   between YOY from the two sites. Otolith-inferred average experienced
   water temperatures were only correlated to fork lengths in Tom's Pond
   YOY. The lack of correlation in Kogluktokoluk Brook YOY is argued to
   reflect resource partitioning occurring as a result of territoriality
   known to occur among stream salmonids. The limited range of temperatures
   used by fluvial YOY in this study, particularly the lack of cooler
   temperatures, also suggests that fluvial YOY may face barriers to
   thermal refugia, and as a result may be particularly vulnerable to
   climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
