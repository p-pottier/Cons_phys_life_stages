Abstract = {The efficacy of a commercial microbial inoculant for improving the
   performance of 10 Western Australian woodland plant species was
   evaluated. Across all investigated species, inoculation had small
   effects on plant growth. Within each species, inoculation did not result
   in significant biomass gain, and effects on nitrogen nutrition and
   photosynthesis were variable and minimal.
   Soil microbial inoculants are increasingly being explored as means to
   improve soil conditions to facilitate ecological restoration. In
   southwestern Western Australia, highly biodiverse Banksia woodland plant
   communities are increasingly threatened by various factors including
   climate change, land development and mining. Banksia woodland
   restoration is necessary to conserve this plant community. The use of
   microbial inoculation in Banksia woodland restoration has not yet been
   investigated. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a commercial microbial
   inoculant (GOGO Juice, Neutrog Australia Pty Ltd) for improving the
   performance of 10 ecologically diverse Banksia woodland plant species in
   a pot experiment. Plants were subjected to one of two watering regimes
   (well-watered and drought) in combination with microbial inoculation
   treatments (non-inoculated and inoculated). Plants were maintained under
   these two watering treatments for 10 weeks, at which point plants in all
   treatments were subjected to a final drought period lasting 8 weeks.
   Plant performance was evaluated by plant biomass and allocation, gas
   exchange parameters, foliar carbon and nitrogen and stable isotope
   (delta 15N and delta 13C) compositions. Plant xylem sap phytohormones
   were analysed to investigate the effect of microbial inoculation on
   plant phytohormone profiles and potential relationships with other
   observed physiological parameters. Across all investigated plant
   species, inoculation treatments had small effects on plant growth.
   Further analysis within each species revealed that inoculation
   treatments did not result in significant biomass gain under well-watered
   or drought-stressed conditions, and effects on nitrogen nutrition and
   photosynthesis were variable and minimal. This suggests that the
   selected commercial microbial inoculant had limited benefits for the
   tested plant species. Further investigations on the compatibility
   between the microorganisms (present in the inoculant) and plants, timing
   of inoculation, viability of the microorganisms and concentration(s)
   required to achieve effectiveness, under controlled conditions, and
   field trials are required to test the feasibility and efficacy in actual
   restoration environments.},

Title = {Normalized difference vegetation index, temperature and age affect
   faecal thyroid hormone concentrations in free-ranging African elephants},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 4},
Abstract = {Conservation biologists can use hormone measurements to assess animals'
   welfare, reproductive state, susceptibility to stressors, as well as
   energy expenditure. Quantifying hormone concentrations from faecal
   samples is particularly advantageous as samples can be collected without
   disturbing animals' behaviour. In order for an endocrine marker to be
   useful for wildlife managers, we need to understand how extrinsic and
   intrinsic factors affect hormone concentrations in free-ranging animal
   populations. Thyroid hormones are linked to basal metabolic rate and
   energy expenditure. Previous research demonstrated that triiodothyronine
   (T3) can be measured successfully in faecal matter of African elephants,
   Loxodonta africana. However, to our knowledge, research into factors
   affecting changes in elephant T3 levels has only been carried out in
   captive elephants so far. Thus, we present the first study of faecal T3
   metabolite (mT3) concentrations of a large population of free-ranging
   African elephants. Over 15 months, we collected faecal samples from
   identified (n=43 samples) and unidentified (n=145 samples) individuals
   in Madikwe Game Reserve, South Africa. We investigated whether
   vegetative productivity {[}normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI)] in interaction with mean monthly temperature, age and sex
   affected mT3 concentrations. We found a significant negative interaction
   effect of NDVI and temperature. Increasing NDVI was related to higher
   concentrations of mT3, but increasing temperature was related to a
   decrease in mT3 concentrations in individually identified and
   unidentified elephants. In unidentified individuals, juvenile elephants
   had significantly higher mT3 concentrations compared to adult elephants.
   Faecal T3 can successfully be quantified in samples from free-ranging
   elephant populations and thus provides insight into energy expenditure
   in large herbivores.},

Title = {Influence of sea ice concentration, sex and chick age on foraging
   flexibility and success in an Arctic seabird},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Thick-billed murres from a low Arctic colony adjusted foraging behaviour
   in response to environmental conditions only during incubation. Whereas
   chick-rearing behaviour and foraging success were impacted by chick age
   and sex, reflecting the high costs of chick demand and sex-specific
   differences in parental care.
   Declining sea ice and increased variability in sea ice dynamics are
   altering Arctic marine food webs. Changes in sea ice dynamics and prey
   availability are likely to impact pagophilic (ice-dependent and
   ice-associated) species, such as thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia),
   through changes in foraging behaviour and foraging success. At the same
   time, extrinsic factors, such as chick demand, and intrinsic factors,
   such as sex, are also likely to influence foraging behaviour and
   foraging success of adult murres. Here, we use 3 years of data
   (2017-2019) to examine the impacts of environmental conditions (sea ice
   concentration and sea surface temperature), sex and chick age (as a
   proxy for chick demand) on foraging and diving behaviour (measured via
   biologgers), energy expenditure (estimated from activity budgets) and
   foraging success (measured via nutritional biomarkers) of thick-billed
   murres during the incubation and chick-rearing stages at Coats Island,
   Nunavut. Murres only exhibited foraging flexibility to environmental
   conditions during incubation, which is also the only stage when ice was
   present. When more ice was present, foraging effort increased, murres
   foraged farther and made deeper dives, where murres making deeper dives
   had higher foraging success (greater relative change in mass). During
   incubation, murre behaviour was also influenced by sex of the
   individual, where males made more and shorter trips and more dives.
   During chick-rearing, murre behaviour was influenced primarily by the
   sex of the individual and chick age. Males made shallower dives and
   fewer dive bouts per day, and more dives. Birds made longer, deeper
   dives as chicks aged, likely representing increased intra-specific
   competition for prey throughout the season. Our results suggest
   variation in sea ice concentration does impact foraging success of
   murres; however, sex-specific foraging strategies may help buffer colony
   breeding success from variability in sea ice concentration.},

Title = {Bridging disciplines to advance elasmobranch conservation: applications
   of physiological ecology},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {A strength of physiological ecology is its incorporation of aspects of
   both species' ecology and physiology; this holistic approach is needed
   to address current and future anthropogenic stressors affecting
   elasmobranch fishes that range from overexploitation to the effects of
   climate change. For example, physiology is one of several key
   determinants of an organism's ecological niche (along with evolutionary
   constraints and ecological interactions). The fundamental role of
   physiology in niche determination led to the development of the field of
   physiological ecology. This approach considers physiological mechanisms
   in the context of the environment to understand mechanistic variations
   that beget ecological trends. Physiological ecology, as an integrative
   discipline, has recently experienced a resurgence with respect to
   conservation applications, largely in conjunction with technological
   advances that extended physiological work from the lab into the natural
   world. This is of critical importance for species such as elasmobranchs
   (sharks, skates and rays), which are an especially understudied and
   threatened group of vertebrates. In 2017, at the American Elasmobranch
   Society meeting in Austin, Texas, the symposium entitled `Applications
   of Physiological Ecology in Elasmobranch Research' provided a platform
   for researchers to showcase work in which ecological questions were
   examined through a physiological lens. Here, we highlight the research
   presented at this symposium, which emphasized the strength of linking
   physiological tools with ecological questions. We also demonstrate the
   applicability of using physiological ecology research as a method to
   approach conservation issues, and advocate for a more available
   framework whereby results are more easily accessible for their
   implementation into management practices.},

Abstract = {Measuring habitat suitability is important in conservation and in
   wildlife management. Measuring the abundance or presence-absence of a
   species in various habitats is not sufficient to measure habitat
   suitability because these metrics can be poor predictors of population
   success. Therefore, having some measure of population success is
   essential in assessing habitat suitability, but estimating population
   success is difficult. Identifying suitable proxies for population
   success could thus be beneficial. We examined whether faecal
   corticosterone metabolite (fCM) concentrations could be used as a proxy
   for habitat suitability in common gartersnakes (Thamnophis sirtalis). We
   conducted a validation study and confirmed that fCM concentrations
   indeed reflect circulating corticosterone concentrations. We estimated
   abundance, reproductive output and growth rate of gartersnakes in field
   and in forest habitat and we also measured fCM concentrations of
   gartersnakes from these same habitats. Common gartersnakes were more
   abundant and had higher reproductive outputs and higher growth rates in
   field habitat than in forest habitat, but fCM concentrations did not
   differ between the same two habitats. Our results suggest either that
   fCM concentrations are not a useful metric of habitat suitability in
   common gartersnakes or that the difference in suitability between the
   two habitats was too small to induce changes in fCM concentrations.
   Incorporating fitness metrics in estimates of habitat suitability is
   important, but these metrics of fitness have to be sensitive enough to
   vary between habitats.},

Title = {Behavioral evidence of olfactory imprinting during embryonic and larval
   stages in lake sturgeon},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Many migratory fishes are thought to navigate to natal streams using
   olfactory cues learned during early life stages. However, direct
   evidence for early-life olfactory imprinting is largely limited to
   Pacific salmon, and other species suspected to imprint show life history
   traits and reproductive strategies that raise uncertainty about the
   generality of the salmonid-based conceptual model of olfactory
   imprinting in fishes. Here, we studied early-life olfactory imprinting
   in lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), which have a life cycle notably
   different from Pacific salmon, but are nonetheless hypothesized to home
   via similar mechanisms. We tested one critical prediction of the
   hypothesis that early-life olfactory imprinting guides natal homing in
   lake sturgeon: that exposure to odorants during early-life stages
   results in increased activity when exposed to those odorants later in
   life. Lake sturgeon were exposed to artificial odorants (phenethyl
   alcohol and morpholine) during specific developmental windows and
   durations (limited to the egg, free-embryo, exogenous feeding larvae and
   juvenile stages), and later tested as juveniles for behavioral responses
   to the odorants that were demonstrative of olfactory memory. Experiments
   revealed that lake sturgeon reared in stream water mixed with artificial
   odorants for as little as 7 days responded to the odorants in behavioral
   assays over 50 days after the initial exposure, specifically implicating
   the free-embryo and larval stages as critical imprinting periods. Our
   study provides evidence for olfactory imprinting in a non-salmonid fish
   species, and supports further consideration of conservation tactics such
   as stream-side rearing facilities that are designed to encourage
   olfactory imprinting to targeted streams during early life stages.
   Continued research on lake sturgeon can contribute to a model of
   olfactory imprinting that is more generalizable across diverse fish
   species and will inform conservation actions for one of the world's most
   imperiled fish taxonomic groups.},

Title = {Resource and seasonality drive interspecific variability in simulations
   from a dynamic energy budget model},

Abstract = {Animals show a vast array of phenotypic traits in time and space. Such
   variation patterns have traditionally been described as ecogeographical
   rules; for example, the tendency of size and clutch size to increase
   with latitude (Bergmann's and Lack's rules, respectively). Despite
   considerable research into these variation patterns and their
   consequences for biodiversity and conservation, the processes behind
   trait variation remain controversial. Here, we show how food
   variability, largely set by climate and weather, can drive interspecific
   trait variation by determining individual energy input and allocation
   trade-offs. Using a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model, we simulated
   different food environments, as well as interspecific variability in the
   parameters for energy assimilation, mobilization and allocation to soma.
   We found that interspecific variability is greater when the resource is
   non-limiting in both constant and seasonal environments. Our findings
   further show that individuals can reach larger biomass and greater
   reproductive output in a seasonal environment than in a constant
   environment of equal average resource due to the peaks of food surplus.
   Our results agree with the classical patterns of interspecific trait
   variation and provide a mechanistic understanding that supports recent
   hypotheses which explain them: the resource and the eNPP (net primary
   production during the growing season) rules. Due to the current
   alterations to ecosystems and communities, disentangling the mechanisms
   of trait variation is increasingly important to understand and predict
   biodiversity dynamics under climate change, as well as to improve
   conservation strategies.
   Animal diversity is reflected not only in species numbers but can also
   include variability in size and fecundity, which the organism's
   environment can shape. Using a description of individual metabolism, we
   show how seasonal food availability can explain diversity in body size
   and reproduction.},

Title = {High survivorship after catch-and-release fishing suggests physiological
   resilience in the endothermic shortfin mako shark (<i>Isurus
   oxyrinchus</i>)},

Abstract = {The shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) is a species commonly
   targeted by commercial and recreational anglers in many parts of the
   developed world. In Australia, the species is targeted by recreational
   anglers only, under the assumption that most of the sharks are released
   and populations remain minimally impacted. If released sharks do not
   survive, the current management strategy will need to be revised.
   Shortfin mako sharks are commonly subjected to lengthy angling events;
   however, their endothermic physiology may provide an advantage over
   ectothermic fishes when recovering from exercise. This study assessed
   the post-release survival of recreationally caught shortfin mako sharks
   using Survivorship Pop-up Archival Transmitting (sPAT) tags and examined
   physiological indicators of capture stress from blood samples as well as
   any injuries that may be caused by hook selection. Survival estimates
   were based on 30 shortfin mako sharks captured off the southeastern
   coast of Australia. Three mortalities were observed over the duration of
   the study, yielding an overall survival rate of 90\%. All mortalities
   occurred in sharks angled for < 30 min. Sharks experienced increasing
   plasma lactate with longer fight times and higher sea surface
   temperatures (SSTs), increased plasma glucose at higher SSTs and
   depressed expression of heat shock protein 70 and beta-hydroxybutyrate
   at higher SSTs. Long fight times did not impact survival. Circle hooks
   significantly reduced foul hooking when compared with J hooks. Under the
   conditions of this study, we found that physical injury associated with
   hook choice is likely to have contributed to an increased likelihood of
   mortality, whereas the high aerobic scope associated with the species'
   endothermy probably enabled it to cope with long fight times and the
   associated physiological responses to capture.},

Title = {A physiological comparison of three techniques for reviving sockeye
   salmon exposed to a severe capture stressor during upriver migration},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Month = {APR 21},
Abstract = {Capture of fish in commercial and recreational fisheries causes
   disruption to their physiological homeostasis and can result in delayed
   mortality for fish that are released. For fish that are severely
   impaired, it may be desirable to attempt revival prior to release to
   reduce the likelihood of post-release mortality. In this study, male
   sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) undergoing their upriver migration
   were used to examine short-term physiological changes during the
   following three revival treatments after beach seine capture and air
   exposure: a pump-powered recovery box that provided ram ventilation at
   one of two water flow rates; and a cylindrical, in-river recovery bag,
   which ensured that fish were oriented into the river flow. Beach seine
   capture followed by a 3 min air exposure resulted in severe impairment
   of reflexes such that fish could not maintain positive orientation or
   properly ventilate. All three revival treatments resulted in significant
   reductions in reflex impairment within 15 min, with full recovery of
   reflex responses observed within 60-120 min. For most variables
   measured, including plasma lactate, cortisol and osmolality, there were
   no significant differences among revival treatments. There was some
   evidence for impaired recovery in the low-flow recovery box, in the form
   of higher haematocrit and plasma sodium. These data mirror published
   recovery profiles for a recovery box study in the marine environment
   where a survival benefit occurred, suggesting that the methods tested
   here are viable options for reviving salmon caught in freshwater.
   Importantly, with most of the benefit to animal vitality accrued in the
   first 15 min, prolonging recovery when fish become vigorous may not
   provide added benefit because the confinement itself is likely to serve
   as a stressor.},

Title = {Using claws to compare reproduction, stress and diet of female bearded
   and ringed seals in the Bering and Chukchi seas, Alaska, between
   1953-1968 and 1998-2014},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Rapid climate warming is decreasing sea ice thickness, extent and
   duration. Marine mammals such as bearded (Erignathus barbatus) and
   ringed (Pusa hispida) seals, which use sea ice for pupping, molting and
   resting, may be negatively affected. Claws from bearded and ringed seals
   store up to 14 and 12 years of sequential analyte data, respectively.
   These data can be used to compare reproduction, stress and diet across
   decades. In this study, we compare progesterone, cortisol and carbon and
   nitrogen stable isotopes in female bearded and ringed seals during
   1953-1968 (pre-1968, a period prior to sea ice decline) to 1998-2014
   (post-1998, a period during sea ice decline). When comparing these
   periods, bearded seals had statistically higher cortisol concentrations
   post-1998, and for both species delta C-13 was more negative post-1998,
   while progesterone and delta N-15 did not change. There was a positive
   relationship between progesterone and cortisol Z-scores for both
   species, except for ringed seals post-1998. There was a negative
   relationship between cortisol Z-scores and delta C-13 for bearded seals
   evident in post-1998 indicating that higher cortisol Z-scores are
   associated with more negative delta C-13 in bearded seals in recent
   years. This negative relationship between cortisol and delta C-13 in
   bearded seals suggests a shift to higher prey diversity, possibly due to
   changes in sea ice in the Pacific Arctic evident post 1998. Progesterone
   Z-scores corresponded to expected differences among non-pregnant,
   unimplanted, implanted and post-partum individuals. Using these data,
   pregnancy history was determined for reproductive years for each
   individual female sampled, which could allow for yearly pregnancy rates
   to be calculated given a large enough representative sample of the
   population. These results combine decades of observational studies with
   hormones and stable isotopes to infer changes in reproduction, stress
   and diet, as well as the connection between these life history
   parameters.},

Title = {Energy budgets of captive Chinese pangolins (Manis pentadactyla)},

Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The Chinese pangolin is an endangered species, and ex situ conservation
   and captive rescue are important conservation measures. This requires
   reliable information on nutritional energy requirements and expenditure
   characteristics. However, we lack sufficient knowledge of their energy
   physiology to determine their energy requirements for maintenance and
   growth. An open-flow respirometry system was used to measure the resting
   metabolic rate (RMR) and the daily energy expenditure (DEE) of Chinese
   pangolins (Manis pentadactyla), and the dietary digestive energy was
   measured. The average RMR in Chinese pangolins was 3.23 ml O-2 kg(-1)
   min(-1) at an ambient temperature (T-a) of 24.5-30 \& DEG;C, which was
   only 73.0\% of the expected value based on body mass (BM). The average
   DEE values were 744.9 kJ day(-1) in animals with BM >3 kg and 597.3 kJ
   day(-1) in those with BM <3 kg, which were only 52.4\% and 60.6\% of the
   predicted values, respectively. The RMR and DEE levels of the Chinese
   pangolin were lower than those of similar-sized eutherian mammals and
   close to those of anteaters. These characteristics suggest that the
   Chinese pangolin has a low demand for energy in its diet. Although
   metabolic level data alone cannot be used to calculate the energy
   requirements of each Chinese pangolin, we believe they can provide a
   tangible reference for the relocation of Chinese pangolins. These
   results provide a scientific basis for future research on the physiology
   and ecology of endangered wildlife such as the Chinese pangolin.
   We measured the metabolic level of Chinese pangolins using breath
   calorimetry, demonstrating that Chinese pangolins have a low metabolic
   rate. Compared to other animals, Chinese pangolins require less energy
   to survive in captivity. This study lays the foundation for better ex
   situ conservation of Chinese pangolins.},

Title = {Consequences of climate-induced vegetation changes exceed those of human
   disturbance for wild impala in the Serengeti ecosystem},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {In East Africa, climate change is predicted to reduce vegetation
   quality, and pervasive human disturbance has already resulted in
   significant declines in biodiversity. We studied the combined effects of
   reduced forage quality and human disturbance on faecal glucocorticoid
   metabolite (FGM) concentrations. Wepredictedthat decreasing nutritional
   quality and increasing human disturbance would have an additive positive
   effect on FGM levels in wild impala (Aepyceros melampus). Employing a
   space-for-time approach, we used normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) as a measure of forage quality, combined with spatially explicit
   proxies of human disturbance across areas of different protection
   management strategies in the Serengeti ecosystem. We collected 639
   faecal samples, spread over 4 years, including both wet and dry seasons.
   Impala FGM levels increased significantly with declining NDVI and, to a
   lesser extent, with increasing proxies for human disturbance. However,
   we found no interaction between the two, such that impala had elevated
   FGM levels with low NDVI and low FGM levels with high NDVI regardless of
   human disturbance levels. This implies that impala will have high FGM
   levels if forage quality is poor, even with significant protection and
   reduced human disturbance. Understanding howanimals respond to and cope
   with changes in forage quality and human land use across different
   protected areas is important for conservationists and managers to better
   protect species at risk and predict population viability.},

Title = {To scale or not to scale: a perspective on describing fish energy
   budgeting},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {Conventionally, dynamic energy budget (DEB) models operate with animals
   that have maintenance rates scaling with their body volume, and
   assimilation rates scaling with body surface area. However, when
   applying such criteria for the individual in a population level model,
   the emergent behaviour of the conventional model apparently only
   reflects juveniles and not adult animals. This paper discusses the
   relevance of what level assumptions are made on, and the subsequent
   impact on interpreting the animal (top-down or bottom-up). The
   alternative DEB model has maintenance scaling with body area, and
   assimilation with body volume-the opposite of the conventional energy
   budget animal. Likewise, scaling of organism function to body mass is
   emphasized to take into account the different challenges organisms face
   when growing in size. It is emphasized that homoeostasis and its
   challenges are continuously changing, and cannot be assumed constant.
   The perspective is finalized by a discussion on perceiving animals as
   machines, and how it can maybe serve as a lingua franca for
   physiologists and modellers alike.},

Title = {Factors affecting energy expenditure in a declining fur seal population},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 26},
Abstract = {Quantifying metabolic rates and the factors that influence them is key
   to wildlife conservation efforts because anthropogenic activities and
   habitat alteration can disrupt energy balance, which is critical for
   reproduction and survival. We investigated the effect of diving
   behaviour, diet and season on field metabolic rates (FMR) and foraging
   success of lactating northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) from the
   Pribil of Islands during a period of population decline. Variation in
   at-sea FMR was in part explained by season and trip duration, with
   values that ranged from 5.18 to 9.68 W kg(-1) (n = 48). Fur seals
   experienced a 7.2\% increase in at-sea FMR from summer to fall and a
   1.9\% decrease in at-sea FMR for each additional day spent at sea. There
   was no effect of foraging effort, dive depth or diet on at-sea FMR. Mass
   gains increased with trip duration and were greater in the fall compared
   with summer, but were unrelated to at-sea FMR, diving behaviour and
   diet. Seasonal increases in at-sea FMR may have been due to costs
   associated with the annual molt but did not appear to adversely impact
   the ability of females to gain mass on foraging trips. The overall high
   metabolic rates in conjunction with the lack of any diet-related effects
   on atsea FMR suggests that northern fur seals may have reached a
   metabolic ceiling early in the population decline. This provides
   indirect evidence that food limitation may be contributing to the low
   pup growth rates observed in the Pribilof Islands, as a high metabolic
   overhead likely results in less available energy for lactation. The
   limited ability of female fur seals to cope with changes in prey
   availability through physiological mechanisms is particularly concerning
   given the recent and unprecedented environmental changes in the Bering
   Sea that are predicted to have ecosystem-level impacts.},

Title = {Limits on performance and survival of juvenile sockeye salmon
   (<i>Oncorhynchus nerka</i>) during food deprivation: a laboratory-based
   study},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Long-distance migrations can be energetically demanding and can
   represent phases of high mortality. Understanding relationships between
   body condition and migratory performance can help illuminate the
   challenges and vulnerabilities of migratory species. Juvenile anadromous
   sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) may migrate over 1000 km from their
   freshwater nursery habitats to estuary and ocean feeding grounds. During
   the period corresponding to the seaward migration of sockeye salmon, we
   held smolts in the laboratory to ask the following: (i) Does non-feeding
   migration duration influence prolonged swim performance and survival?
   (ii) What are the relationships between individual body condition and
   swim performance and survival? Wild sockeye salmon were intercepted
   during their migration and held without food for up to 61 days to
   represent the non-feeding freshwater migration and the extremes of poor
   estuary habitat. We conducted 40 sets of prolonged swim trials on 319
   fish from 3 treatment groups that represented entrance to the marine
   environment on (i) an average,(ii) a delayed and (iii) a severely
   delayed migration schedule. Experimentally controlled freshwater
   migration duration did not impact swim performance or survival. Swim
   performance decreased concomitant with condition factor, where smolts
   with a Fulton's condition factor of <0.69 were less likely (<50\%
   probability) to complete the swim test (90 min swim test, at similar to
   0.50 m/s). Survival of salmon smolts in the laboratory was less likely
   at energy densities of less than 3.47 MJ/kg. Swim performance decreased
   much sooner than survival, suggesting that swim performance, and
   therefore condition factor, may be a good indicator of survival of
   migratory smolts, as fish with reduced swim performance will likely be
   predated. These two relationships, one more ecologically relevant and
   one more clinical, help reveal the limits of long-distance migration for
   juvenile salmon and can be used to determine population-specific
   starvation risk associated with various freshwater and marine habitat
   conditions.},

Title = {Assessments at multiple levels of biological organization allow for an
   integrative determination of physiological tolerances to turbidity in an
   endangered fish species},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Turbidity can influence trophic levels by altering species composition
   and can potentially affect fish feeding strategies and predator-prey
   interactions. The estuarine turbidity maximum, described as an area of
   increased suspended particles, phytoplankton and zooplankton, generally
   represents a zone with higher turbidity and enhanced food sources
   important for successful feeding and growth in many fish species. The
   delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) is an endangered, pelagic fish
   species endemic to the San Francisco Estuary and Sacramento-San Joaquin
   River Delta, USA, where it is associated with turbid waters. Turbidity
   is known to play an important role for the completion of the species'
   life cycle; however, turbidity ranges in the Delta are broad, and
   specific requirements for this fish species are still unknown. To
   evaluate turbidity requirements for early life stages, late-larval delta
   smelt were maintained at environmentally relevant turbidity levels
   ranging from 5 to 250 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) for 24 h,
   after which a combination of physiological endpoints (molecular
   biomarkers and cortisol), behavioural indices (feeding) and
   whole-organism measures (survival) were determined. All endpoints
   delivered consistent results and identified turbidities between 25 and
   80 NTU as preferential. Delta smelt survival rates were highest between
   12 and 80 NTU and feeding rates were highest between 25 and 80 NTU.
   Cortisol levels indicated minimal stress between 35 and 80 NTU and were
   elevated at low turbidities (5, 12 and 25 NTU). Expression of
   stress-related genes indicated significant responses for gst, hsp70 and
   glut2 in high turbidities (250 NTU), and principal component analysis on
   all measured genes revealed a clustering of 25, 35, 50 and 80 NTU
   separating the medium-turbidity treatments from low- and high-turbidity
   treatments. Taken together, these data demonstrate that turbidity levels
   that are either too low or too high affect delta smelt physiological
   performance, causing significant effects on overall stress, food intake
   and mortality. They also highlight the need for turbidity to be
   considered in habitat and water management decisions.},

Title = {Variation of hair cortisol in two herds of migratory caribou (Rangifer

Abstract = {Migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus sspp.) is an ecotype of
   conservation concern that is experiencing increased cumulative stressors
   associated with rapid climate change and development in Arctic Canada.
   Increasingly, hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs) are being used to
   monitor seasonal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity of
   ungulate populations; yet, the effect of key covariates for caribou
   (sex, season, sampling source, body location) are largely unknown. The
   objectives of this research were 4-fold: first, we assessed the impact
   of body location (neck, rump) sampling sites on HCC; second, we assessed
   key covariates (sex, sampling method, season) impacting HCCs of caribou;
   third, we investigated inter-population (Dolphin and Union (DU),
   Bluenose-East (BNE)) and inter-annual differences in HCC and fourth, we
   examined the association between HCCs and indices of biting insect
   activity on the summer range (oestrid index, mosquito index). We
   examined hair from 407 DU and BNE caribou sampled by harvesters or
   during capture-collaring operations from 2012 to 2020. Linear
   mixed-effect models were used to assess the effect of body location on
   HCC and generalized least squares regression (GLS) models were used to
   examine the impacts of key covariates, year and herd and indices of
   biting insect harassment. HCC varied significantly by body location,
   year, herd and source of samples (harvester vs capture). HCC was higher
   in samples taken from the neck and in the DU herd compared with the BNE,
   decreased linearly over time and was higher in captured versus hunted
   animals (P < 0.05). There was no difference in HCC between sexes, and
   indices of biting insect harassment in the previous year were not
   significantly associated with HCC. This study identifies essential
   covariates impacting the HCC of caribou that must be accounted for in
   sampling, monitoring and data interpretation.},

Abstract = {Arenicola marina, a marine benthic polychaete, is widespread on sandy
   beaches in Europe and considered as an ecosystem engineer despite
   commonly used as bait by fishermen. Data regarding the bioenergetics of
   the lugworm larval stages are still incomplete. Trochophore is initially
   lecithotroph and then becomes planktotroph while growing as
   metatrochophore on subtidal area, a quite stable daily temperature
   environment compared with the foreshore, where juveniles and adult live,
   with daily temperature fluctuating up to 15 degrees C. These
   discrepancies in temperature ranges may influence the temperature
   corrections (TCs) that control metabolic rates during the life cycle of
   A. marina. We carried out laboratory experiments in microcosms by
   inducing artificial spawning of lugworms, and then undertaken in vitro
   fertilization to obtain embryos and, finally, to follow, the larval
   development up to 10 segments with chaetae for 50 days under three
   temperature conditions (13 degrees C, 15 degrees C and 17 degrees C) and
   two food conditions ('fed'and `non-fed'). The first feeding ('birth') of
   A. marina larvae was deciphered anatomically for a size between 450 and
   500 itm and described at 17 days post-fertilization for larvae reared at
   15 degrees C and 17 degrees C. Using a biphasic model with a von
   Bertalanffy growth before `birth' and an exponential growth after
   `birth, among the three temperature treatments, the 15 degrees C
   condition exhibited the best larval performance. TC based on embryonic
   and larval metabolic rates gave an Arrhenius temperature of similar to
   6661 K and a higher boundary temperature tolerance range of similar to
   294.5 K. Both temperature values differ from those calculated from TC
   based mostly on juvenile and adult metabolic rates. We claim to use two
   sets of Arrhenius temperatures according to the life history stages of
   A. marina while using Dynamic Energy Budget model. This model was
   developed initially in order to manage the conservation of the lugworm
   species.},

Title = {Fatty acid composition and parasitism of European sardine (<i>Sardina

   in the northern Catalan Sea in the context of changing environmental

Abstract = {The status of sardine and anchovy populations in the northern
   Mediterranean Sea has been declining in recent decades. In this study,
   fatty acids and parasitism at different reproductive and feeding stages
   in these two species were assessed using specimens caught along the
   northern Catalan coast, in order to assess the links between lipid
   dynamics, reproduction and feeding in these two species and to
   contribute towards an explanation of the potential causes of the current
   poor situation of the stocks. The results support the use of fatty acid
   levels as indicators of the body condition of sardine and anchovy at
   different reproductive and feeding stages, as well as that of the
   pelagic environmental conditions. In particular, the relatively low n-3
   polyunsaturated fatty acid levels found in spawning sardines compared to
   spawning anchovies indicate a poorer reproductive health status of
   sardine. By comparing the current total lipid content values with those
   recorded in other Mediterranean and North Atlantic areas, and others
   from more than 10 years ago, in the adjacent area of the Gulf of Lion,
   our study reveals the persistent poor condition of sardine and anchovy
   in the northern Catalan Sea. Furthermore, the low levels of diatom fatty
   acid markers observed throughout the spawning and non-spawning seasons
   in both sardine and anchovy indicate a diet poor in diatoms. Moreover,
   the results indicate that it is very unlikely that parasitism is a
   significant factor in the decline in condition of sardine and anchovy in
   the northern Catalan Sea. In fact, the results, which we believe provide
   useful insights for the management of small pelagic fisheries in the
   Mediterranean, suggest that the current poor condition of sardine and
   anchovy in the northern Catalan Sea has probably been exacerbated by a
   decrease in plankton productivity and/or a shift in the taxonomic
   composition of phytoplankton communities, adding to the ongoing effects
   of overfishing.},

Title = {Gill slits provide a window into the respiratory physiology of sharks},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 4},
Abstract = {Metabolically important traits, such as gill surface area and metabolic
   rate, underpin life histories, population dynamics and extinction risk,
   as they govern the availability of energy for growth, survival and
   reproduction. Estimating both gill surface area and metabolic rate can
   be challenging, especially when working with large-bodied, threatened
   species. Ideally, these traits, and respiratory physiology in general,
   could be inferred from external morphology using a faster, non-lethal
   method. Gill slit height is quick to measure on live organisms and is
   anatomically connected to the gill arch. Here, we relate gill slit
   height and gill surface area for five Carcharhiniform sharks. We
   compared both total and parabranchial gill surface area to mean and
   individual gill slit height in physical specimens. We also compared
   empirical measurements of relative gill slit height (i.e. in proportion
   to total length) to those estimated from field guide illustrations to
   examine the potential of using anatomical drawings to measure gill slit
   height. We find strong positive relationships between gill slit height
   and gill surface area at two scales: (i) for total gill surface area and
   mean gill slit height across species and (ii) for parabranchial gill
   surface area and individual gill slit height within and across species.
   We also find that gill slit height is a consistent proportion of the
   fork length of physical specimens. Consequently, relative gill slit
   height measured from field guide illustrations proved to be surprisingly
   comparable to those measured from physical specimens. While the
   generality of our findings needs to be evaluated across a wider range of
   taxonomy and ecological lifestyles, they offer the opportunity that we
   might only need to go to the library and measure field guide
   illustrations to yield a non-lethal, first- order approximation of the
   respiratory physiology of sharks.},

Title = {Biochemical and biological validations of a faecal glucocorticoid
   metabolite assay in mandrills (<i>Mandrillus sphinx</i>)},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Stress is a major factor in determining success when releasing
   endangered species into the wild but is often overlooked. Mandrills
   (Mandrills sphinx) are vulnerable to extinction due to habitat loss and
   demand for bush meat and the pet trade. To help bolster in situ
   populations, rehabilitated rescued mandrills recently were released into
   a protected area in the Republic of Congo. The goal of this study was to
   validate the use of faecal glucocorticoid metabolite enzyme immunoassays
   (EIAs) in mandrills and test field-friendly faecal hormone extraction
   techniques that can subsequently be used to monitor the stress
   physiology and welfare of mandrills throughout the release process.
   Using faecal samples collected from ex situ mandrills, we tested
   cortisol, corticosterone, 11 beta-hydroxyetiocholanolone (69a), and
   11-oxoetiocholanolone EIAs. Absolute concentrations, hormone profiles
   following medical procedures or translocation, and high-performance
   liquid chromatography fraction immunoreactivity showed that the 69a
   assay was the best choice to monitor the stress response in this
   species. Samples with delayed extraction or drying times had 40-80\%
   lower 69a concentrations than samples extracted immediately
   post-collection and frozen. The 69a EIA is an appropriate assay for
   monitoring welfare in this species in situ or ex situ, and results
   indicated that consistent extraction methods are important for accurate
   comparisons.},

Title = {The comparative energetics of the ray-finned fish in an evolutionary

Abstract = {Life history and energetics of Actinopterygii are analysed using
   parameters and traits from the Add-my-Pet collection. Actinopterygii are
   the only vertebrate class that shows metabolic acceleration a short
   period after birth, and they are near the supply-end of the
   supply-demand spectrum. Many small freshwater species sport the
   waste-to-hurry strategy.
   To address challenges in management and conservation of fishes and
   fisheries it is essential to understand their life histories and
   energetics. The Add-my-Pet (AmP) collection of data on energetics and
   Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) parameters currently contains 1150 of the
   40000 extant species of fish. It gives 250-280 traits per species,
   depending on the model type that was applied, such as maximum reserve
   capacity, lifespan, specific respiration and precociality index, based
   on which the ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) was compared with the four
   other fish classes (Cyclostomata, Chondrichthyes, Actinistia, Dipnoi)
   and the Tetrapoda. The Actinopterygii are the only vertebrate class that
   shows metabolic acceleration, and clearly so in only three sub-clades.
   Different from chondrichthyans, quite a few species follow the
   waste-to-hurry strategy, especially small bodied freshwater fish such as
   tropical annual killifish, but also in small minnows and darters in
   continental climates. We briefly discuss links between waste-to-hurry,
   which is associated with a large specific somatic maintenance, and
   sensitivity for pesticides. We discuss why this interferes with the
   physical co-variation between maximum reserve capacity and ultimate
   structural length or weight and explains why maximum reserve capacity
   increases with body length in chondrichthyans, but not in
   actinopterygians. Reserve capacity has relevance, e.g. mass-specific
   maintenance, starvation and the kinetics of lipophyllic compounds (such
   as pesticides), since reserve is relatively rich in lipids in fish.
   Also, unlike chondrichthyans, the size at birth is very small and not
   linked to ultimate size; we discuss the implications. Actinopterygians
   allocate more to soma, compared with chondrichthyans; the latter
   allocate more to maturity or reproduction. Actinopterygians, Actinistia
   and Dipnoi are near the supply-end of the supply-demand spectrum, while
   chondrichthyans clearly show demand properties.},

Title = {Integrating physiological stress into the movement ecology of migratory
   ungulates: a spatial analysis with mule deer},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Rapid climate and human land-use change may limit the ability of
   long-distance migratory herbivores to optimally track or `surf'
   high-quality forage during spring green-up. Understanding how
   anthropogenic and environmental stressors influence migratory movements
   is of critical importance because of their potential to cause a mismatch
   between the timing of animal movements and the emergence of high-quality
   forage. We measured stress hormones (fecal glucocorticoid metabolites;
   FGMs) to test hypotheses about the effects of high-quality forage
   tracking, human land-use and use of stopover sites on the physiological
   state of individuals along a migratory route. We collected and analysed
   FGM concentrations from 399 mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) samples
   obtained along a 241-km migratory route in western Wyoming, USA, during
   spring 2015 and 2016. In support of a fitness benefit hypothesis,
   individuals occupying areas closer to peak forage quality had decreased
   FGM levels. Specifically, for every 10-day interval closer to peak
   forage quality, we observed a 7\% decrease in FGMs. Additionally, we
   observed support for both an additive anthropogenic stress hypothesis
   and a hypothesis that stopovers act as physiological refugia, wherein
   individuals sampled far from stopover sites exhibited 341\% higher FGM
   levels if in areas of low landscape integrity compared to areas of high
   landscape integrity. Overall, our findings indicate that the
   physiological state of mule deer during migration is influenced by both
   anthropogenic disturbances and their ability to track high-quality
   forage. The availability of stopovers, however, modulates physiological
   responses to those stressors. Thus, our results support a recent call
   for the prioritization of stopover locations and connectivity between
   those locations in conservation planning for migratory large herbivores.},

Title = {Divergent impacts of the neonicotinoid insecticide, clothianidin, on
   flight performance metrics in two species of migratory butterflies},

Abstract = {Long-distance flight is crucial for the survival of migratory insects,
   and disruptions to their flight capacity can have significant
   consequences for conservation. In this study, we examined how a widely
   used insecticide, clothianidin (class: neonicotinoid), impacted the
   flight performance of two species of migratory butterflies, monarchs
   (Danaus plexippus) and painted ladies (Vanessa cardui). To do this, we
   quantified the free-flight energetics and tethered-flight velocity and
   distance of the two species using flow-through respirometry and flight
   mill assays. Our findings show differential effects of the pesticide on
   the two species. For painted ladies, we found that clothianidin exposure
   reduced average free-flight metabolic rates, but did not affect either
   average velocity or total distance during tethered flight. Other studies
   have linked low flight metabolic rates with reduced dispersal capacity,
   indicating that clothianidin exposure may hinder painted lady flight
   performance in the wild. Conversely, for monarchs, we saw no significant
   effect of clothianidin exposure on average free-flight metabolic rates
   but did observe increases in the average velocity, and for large
   individuals, total distance achieved by clothianidin-exposed monarchs in
   tethered flight. This suggests a potential stimulatory response of
   monarchs to low-dose exposures to clothianidin. These findings indicate
   that clothianidin exposure has the potential to influence the flight
   performance of butterflies, but that not all species are impacted in the
   same way. This highlights the need to be thoughtful when selecting
   performance assays, as different assays can evaluate fundamentally
   distinct aspects of physiology, and as such may yield divergent results.},

Title = {Biological validation of faecal corticosterone metabolites as a
   non-invasive stress assessment in translocated California valley quail
   (Callipepla californica)},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},

Abstract = {US quail species are vulnerable to population declines as a result of
   climate change, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation, all of which can
   result in physiological stress. Additionally, population restoration
   techniques (PRTs), like translocations, also induce stress. Traditional
   assessments of avian stress hormone levels include capturing and
   handling birds to extract blood, methods that are inherently stressful
   and can compound stress analyses. However, the stress hormone
   corticosterone (CORT) is metabolized from the blood and excreted in
   faeces as faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs). FCMs have been used
   as a non-invasive measurement of stress hormone levels in a variety of
   species, but must be validated for each species. The objective of this
   study was to biologically validate the use of FCMs as a non-invasive
   measurement of CORT levels in California valley quail (Callipepla
   californica). Reference and treatment quail were acclimated for 3 weeks
   in an outdoor aviary. Subsequently, treatment quail were subjected to a
   simulated 48-h translocation, a common and stress hormone-inducing PRT.
   Faecal samples were collected every 4 h and processed using an enzyme
   immunoassay. Mean FCM concentrations of treatment quail (41.50 +/- 16.13
   ng/g) were higher than reference FCM concentrations (24.07 +/- 10.4
   ng/g). These results biologically validate the use of FCMs as a
   non-invasive method to assess CORT levels in California valley quail,
   demonstrate diurnal variation in quail CORT levels, and confirm that
   quail translocations are a stress-inducing PRT. Ultimately, this
   research validates a new non-invasive tool for stress response
   measurement to advance quail research, management and conservation.
   This study biologically validates the use of faecal corticosterone
   metabolites as a non-invasive method for detecting stress in quail,
   demonstrates diurnal variation in quail stress levels, confirms that
   translocations elevate stress, which likely impacts success, and
   establishes a new non-invasive tool for stress measurement in quail
   research, management and conservation.},

Title = {Effects of natural environmental conditions on faecal glucocorticoid
   metabolite concentrations in jaguars (<i>Panthera onca</i>) in Belize},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {In situ studies that rely on non-invasive faecal hormone monitoring are
   subject to problems due to potential changes in hormone concentrations
   in samples exposed to field conditions. In this study, we conducted an
   environmental validation for measurement of faecal glucocorticoid
   metabolites (FGMs) in jaguars (Panthera onca). We collected fresh faeces
   (e.g. no older than 8 h) from jaguars (six males and four females),
   housed at the Belize Zoo, and exposed them randomly to two environmental
   conditions: shade and sun. A control (first sub-sample) was immediately
   frozen, after which sub-samples were frozen daily over a 5 day period in
   both the dry and wet seasons. We quantified FGMs using a cortisol enzyme
   immunoassay (EIA) and a corticosterone radioimmunoassay (RIA), both
   capable of identifying relevant metabolites. Results indicated that FGMs
   assessed with the cortisol EIA were stable for 5 days during the dry
   season but for <1 day during the wet season, while FGMs assessed with
   the corticosterone RIA were stable for 5 days during both the dry and
   wet seasons. Exposure of jaguar faeces to sun or shade had no effect on
   FGM concentrations, despite significant differences in weather
   parameters. Analysis of faecal morphology proved unreliable in
   identifying faecal age. We conclude that the corticosterone RIA is
   suitable for assessing FGMs in free-ranging Belizean jaguars by
   surveying the same transects every 3-4 days in both seasons. The
   cortisol EIA can be used during the dry season, but there are possible
   shifts in metabolite immunoactivity in wet conditions. Assessment of
   adrenal activity in jaguars ranging areas of varying human disturbance
   is a timely application of this methodology in Belize.},

Title = {Urofaecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations in African penguin

Abstract = {Despite the importance of ecotourism in species conservation, little is
   known about the industry's effects on wildlife. In South Africa, some
   African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) colonies have become tourist
   attractions. The species is globally endangered, with population sizes
   decreasing over the past 40 years. AsAfrican penguin chicks are
   altricial and unable tomove away fromanthropogenic stressors, it is
   important to evaluate the effect of tourist activities on baseline
   glucocorticoid levels as a measure of potential disturbance. Chicks at
   three study sites within two breeding colonies (Robben Island, Stony
   Point), with varying levels of exposure to tourism (low/moderate/high)
   were monitored. Urofaecal samples were collected to determine urofaecal
   glucocorticoid metabolite (ufGCM) concentrations as an indication of
   baseline stress physiology. Morphometric measurements were taken to
   compare body condition between sites. Penguin chicks experiencing low,
   infrequent human presence had significantly higher mean (+/- standard
   deviation) ufGCM levels {[}1.34 +/- 1.70 mu g/g dry weight (DW)]
   compared to chicks experiencing both medium (0.50 +/- 0.40 mu g/g DW, P=
   0.001) and high levels of human presence (0.57 +/- 0.47 mu g/g DW, P=
   0.003). There was no difference in chick body condition across sites.
   These results suggest that exposure to frequent human activity may
   induce habituation/desensitization in African penguin chicks. Acute,
   infrequent human presence was likely an important driver for
   comparatively higher ufGCM levels in chicks, though several other
   environmental stressors may also play an important role in driving
   adrenocortical activity. Nevertheless, as unhabituated chicks
   experiencing infrequent anthropogenic presence showed significantly
   higher ufGCM levels, managers and legislation should attempt to minimize
   all forms of activity around important breeding colonies that are not
   already exposed to regular tourism. Although the results of this study
   are crucial for developing enhanced conservation and management
   protocols, additional research on the long-term effect of anthropogenic
   activities on African penguin physiology is required.},

Abstract = {In the face of insect declines, identifying phases of the life cycle
   when insects are particularly vulnerable to mortality is critical to
   conservation efforts. For numerous annual insect groups, diapause is
   both a key adaptation that allows survival of inhospitable conditions
   and a physiologically demanding life stage that can result in high rates
   of mortality. As bees continue to garner attention as a group
   experiencing high rates of decline, improving our understanding of how
   annual bees prepare for diapause and identifying factors that reduce
   survival is imperative. Here, we studied factors affecting diapause
   survival length and their underlying mechanisms using an economically
   and ecologically important annual bee species, Bombus impatiens. We
   examined how age and mass upon diapause onset correlate with diapause
   survival length, and the mechanistic role of nutrient acquisition and
   oxidative stress post pupal eclosion in mediating these effects. Our
   findings show that both age and mass were strong predictors of diapause
   survival length. Heavier queens or queens in the age range of similar to
   6-17 days survived longer in diapause. Mass gain was attributed to
   increases in lipid, protein and glycerol amounts following pupal
   eclosion, and the ability to deal with oxidative stress was
   significantly compromised in older pre-diapause queens. Our results
   demonstrate that age-related shifts in bee physiology and timing of
   nutrient acquisition may both be critical factors driving diapause
   survival.},

Title = {Tracking transcriptomic responses to endogenous and exogenous variation
   in cetaceans in the Southern California Bight},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Marine wildlife populations are adapted to survive in highly dynamic
   environments. However, identifying the effects of endogenous versus
   exogenous variables on marine mammal physiology remains a substantial
   challenge in part because of the logistical constraints that limit the
   collection of physiological data in free-ranging animals. Measuring
   genome-wide gene expression is one minimally invasive method that can be
   used to elucidate how free-ranging cetaceans' physiological responses
   shift with changing environmental conditions or demographic states, i.e.
   reproductive status and maturity. We identified transcriptomic
   differences among bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the
   Southern California Bight using RNAseq data from the skin of 75
   individuals to examine gene expression associated with sex, pregnancy
   status, sea surface temperature, geographic location and ecotype. We
   identified transcriptomic variation between two genetically distinct
   ecotypes as well as variation related to environmental conditions among
   groups that exhibit little evidence of genetic divergence. Specifically,
   we found differential expression of genes associated with structural
   development, cellular starvation and immune response. Sex and pregnancy
   status explained a small proportion of the observed variation, in
   contrast to sea surface temperature, which explained a substantial
   amount of transcriptomic variation. However, these measured variables
   did not account for all of the differential expression observed between
   ecotypes and among geographically distinct groups. Additional research
   is needed to identify other endogenous or exogenous factors that may be
   contributing to observed transcriptomic differences among ecotypes.},

Title = {Capture severity, infectious disease processes and sex influence
   post-release mortality of sockeye salmon bycatch},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Bycatch is a common occurrence in heavily fished areas such as the
   Fraser River, British Columbia, where fisheries target returning adult
   Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) en route to spawning grounds. The
   extent to which these encounters reduce fish survival through injury and
   physiological impairment depends on multiple factors including capture
   severity, river temperature and infectious agents. In an effort to
   characterize the mechanisms of post-release mortality and address
   fishery and managerial concerns regarding specific regulations,
   wild-caught Early Stuart sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were
   exposed to either mild (20 s) or severe (20 min) gillnet entanglement
   and then held at ecologically relevant temperatures throughout their
   period of river migration (mid-late July) and spawning (early August).
   Individuals were biopsy sampled immediately after entanglement and at
   death to measure indicators of stress and immunity, and the infection
   intensity of 44 potential pathogens. Biopsy alone increased mortality
   (males: 33\%, females: 60\%) when compared with nonbiopsied controls
   (males: 7\%, females: 15\%), indicating high sensitivity to any handling
   during river migration, especially among females. Mortality did not
   occur until 5-10 days after entanglement, with severe entanglement
   resulting in the greatest mortality (males: 62\%, females: 90\%),
   followed by mild entanglement (males: 44\%, females: 70\%). Infection
   intensities of Flavobacterium psychrophilum and Ceratonova shasta
   measured at death were greater in fish that died sooner. Physiological
   indicators of host stress and immunity also differed depending on
   longevity, and indicated anaerobic metabolism, osmoregulatory failure
   and altered immune gene regulation in premature mortalities. Together,
   these results implicate latent effects of entanglement, especially among
   females, resulting in mortality days or weeks after release. Although
   any entanglement is potentially detrimental, reducing entanglement
   durations can improve post-release survival.},

Title = {Exposure to bloom-like concentrations of two marine <i>Synechococcus
   cyanobacteria</i> (strains CC9311 and CC9902) differentially alters fish
   behaviour},

Abstract = {Coastal California experiences large-scale blooms of Synechococcus
   cyanobacteria, which are predicted to become more prevalent by the end
   of the 21st century as a result of global climate change. This study
   investigated whether exposure to bloom-like concentrations of two
   Synechococcus strains, CC9311 and CC9902, alters fish behaviour. Black
   perch (Embiotoca jacksoni) were exposed to Synechococcus strain CC9311
   or CC9902 (1.5 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)) or to control seawater in
   experimental aquaria for 3 days. Fish movement inside a testing arena
   was then recorded and analysed using video camera-based motion-tracking
   software. Compared with control fish, fish exposed to CC9311
   demonstrated a significant preference for the dark zone of the tank in
   the light-dark test, which is an indication of increased anxiety.
   Furthermore, fish exposed to CC9311 also had a statistically significant
   decrease in velocity and increase in immobility and they meandered more
   in comparison to control fish. There was a similar trend in velocity,
   immobility and meandering in fish exposed to CC9902, but there were no
   significant differences in behaviour or locomotion between this group
   and control fish. Identical results were obtained with a second batch of
   fish. Additionally, in this second trial we also investigated whether
   fish would recover after a 3 day period in seawater without
   cyanobacteria. Indeed, there were no longer any significant differences
   in behaviour among treatments, demonstrating that the sp. CC9311-induced
   alteration of behaviour is reversible. These results demonstrate that
   blooms of specific marine Synechococcus strains can induce differential
   sublethal effects in fish, namely alterations light-dark preference
   behaviour and motility.},

Title = {Heart rate responses provide an objective evaluation of human
   disturbance stimuli in breeding birds},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Intuition is a poor guide for evaluating the effects of human
   disturbance on wildlife. Using the endangered Yellow-eyed penguin,
   Megadyptes antipodes, as an example, we show that heart rate responses
   provide an objective tool to evaluate human disturbance stimuli and
   encourage the wider use of this simple and low-impact approach.
   Yellow-eyed penguins are a flagship species for New Zealand's wildlife
   tourism; however, unregulated visitor access has recently been
   associated with reduced breeding success and lower first year survival.
   We measured heart rate responses of Yellow-eyed penguins via artificial
   eggs to evaluate a range of human stimuli regularly occurring at their
   breeding sites. We found the duration of a stimulus to be the most
   important factor, with elevated heart rate being sustained while a
   person remained within sight. Human activity was the next important
   component; a simulated wildlife photographer, crawling slowly around
   during his stay, elicited a significantly higher heart rate response
   than an entirely motionless human spending the same time at the same
   distance. Stimuli we subjectively might perceive as low impact, such as
   the careful approach of a `wildlife photographer', resulted in a
   stronger response than a routine nest-check that involved lifting a bird
   up to view nest contents. A single, slow-moving human spending 20 min
   within 2 m from the nest may provoke a response comparable to that of 10
   min handling a bird for logger deployment. To reduce cumulative impact
   of disturbance, any human presence in the proximity of Yellow-eyed
   penguins needs to be kept at a minimum. Our results highlight the need
   for objective quantification of the effects of human disturbance in
   order to provide a sound basis for guidelines to manage human activity
   around breeding birds.},

   capture have been well studied in commercial and recreational fisheries,
   this issue has been overlooked for the ornamental fish trade, where it
   is common to capture fish from the wild and discard non-target species.
   We examined metabolic responses to capture and discard procedures in the
   three-striped dwarf cichlid Apistogramma trifasciata, a popular
   Amazonian aquarium species that nonetheless may be discarded when not a
   target species. Individuals (n = 34) were tagged and exposed to each of
   four treatments designed to simulate procedures during the capture and
   discard process: 1) a non-handling control; 2) netting; 3) netting +30
   seconds of air exposure; and 4) netting +60 seconds of air exposure.
   Metabolic rates were estimated using intermittent-flow respirometry,
   immediately following each treatment then throughout recovery overnight.
   Increasing amounts of netting and air exposure caused an acute increase
   in oxygen uptake and decrease in available aerobic scope. In general,
   recovery occurred quickly, with rapid decreases in oxygen uptake within
   the first 30 minutes post-handling. Notably, however, male fish exposed
   to netting +60 seconds of air exposure showed a delayed response whereby
   available aerobic scope was constrained <75\% of maximum until similar
   to 4-6 hours post-stress. Larger fish showed a greater initial increase
   in oxygen uptake post-stress and slower rates of recovery. The results
   suggest that in the period following discard, this species may
   experience a reduced aerobic capacity for additional
   behavioural/physiological responses including feeding, territory defence
   and predator avoidance. These results are among the first to examine
   impacts of discard practises in the ornamental fishery and suggest
   ecophysiological research can provide valuable insight towards
   increasing sustainable practises in this global trade.},

Title = {Serum Virome of Southern Beaufort Sea polar bears (Ursus maritimus)
   during a period of rapid climate change},

Abstract = {We characterized the serum virome of polar bears from Alaska\#x2019;s
   Beaufort Sea. We identified 48 anelloviruses, which in humans are linked
   to immunosuppression. Polar bear anelloviruses did not vary with
   physiological, behavioral or demographic factors, but do appear to
   change with time. These data provide a baseline for assessing future
   changes.
   Climate change affects the behavior, physiology and life history of many
   Arctic wildlife species. It can also influence the distribution and
   ecology of infectious agents. The southern Beaufort Sea (SB)
   subpopulation of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) has experienced dramatic
   behavioral changes due to retreating sea ice and other climate-related
   factors, but the effects of these changes on physiology and infection
   remain poorly understood. Using serum from polar bears sampled between
   2004 and 2015 and metagenomic DNA sequencing, we identified 48 viruses,
   all of the family Anelloviridae. Anelloviruses are small, ubiquitous
   infectious agents with circular single-stranded DNA genomes that are not
   known to cause disease but, in humans, covary in diversity and load with
   immunological compromise. We therefore examined the usefulness of
   anelloviruses as biomarkers of polar bear physiological stress related
   to climate and habitat use. Polar bear anelloviruses sorted into two
   distinct clades on a phylogenetic tree, both of which also contained
   anelloviruses of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), another ursid.
   Neither anellovirus diversity nor load were associated with any
   demographic variables, behavioral factors or direct physiological
   measures. However, pairwise genetic distances between anelloviruses were
   positively correlated with pairwise differences in sampling date,
   suggesting that the polar bear ``anellome{''} is evolving over time.
   These findings suggest that anelloviruses are not a sensitive indicator
   of polar physiological stress, but they do provide a baseline for
   evaluating future changes to polar bear viromes.},

Title = {Validation of a novel method to create temporal records of hormone
   concentrations from the claws of ringed and bearded seals},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Ringed (Pusa hispida) and bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) inhabit
   vast and often remote areas in the Arctic, making it difficult to obtain
   long-term physiological information concerning health and reproduction.
   These seals are experiencing climate-driven changes in their habitat
   that could result in physiological stress. Chronic physiological stress
   can lead to immunosuppression, decreased reproduction and decreased
   growth. Recently, keratin has become a popular matrix to measure steroid
   hormones, such as stress-related cortisol and reproduction-related
   progesterone. We developed and validated methods to extract cortisol and
   progesterone from the claws of adult female ringed (n = 20) and bearded
   (n = 3) seals using enzyme immunosorbent assays. As ringed and bearded
   seal claws grow, a pair of dark- and light-colored bands of keratin is
   deposited annually providing a guide for sampling. Two processing
   methods were evaluated, removal of claw material with a grinding bit or
   grinding followed by mechanical pulverization (102 paired samples from
   six claws, two each from three seals). Adding the mechanical
   pulverization step resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in hormone
   extraction. Progesterone from the proximal claw band was evaluated to
   biologically validate claw material as a measure of pregnancy in ringed
   seals (n = 14). Claws from pregnant seals had significantly higher claw
   progesterone concentrations than from non-pregnant seals. This suggests
   that the elevated progesterone associated with gestation was reflected
   in the claws, and that the most proximal claw band was indicative of
   pregnancy status at time of death. Thus, although the sample size was
   low and the collection dates unbalanced, this study demonstrates the
   potential to use claws to examine an extended time series (up to 12 yrs)
   of cortisol and progesterone concentrations in ringed and bearded seal
   claws.},

Abstract = {Elevated glucocorticoid (GC) concentration and increased vigilance are
   two common responses to predation risk in mammals. Chronic high-level GC
   concentration and vigilance occur at the expense of other life
   maintenance and reproduction activities, reflecting a trade-off between
   individual survival and future fecundity. Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra
   przewalskii) is a group-living ungulate endemic to the high-altitude
   Qinghai Lake region of China. Group-size effect on gazelle vigilance has
   been examined, yet little is known about how their GC concentration is
   affected by group size or reproductive status. In this study, we
   examined the effect of group size and reproductive status on faecal
   glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations and individual vigilance
   during different stages of the reproduction cycle (i.e. non-breeding,
   lambing and rutting) in free-ranging adult female Przewalski's gazelles.
   Group size did not influence FGMs significantly, but mean vigilance
   duration increased with group size. The gazelles' FGMs and vigilance
   peaked in lambing season. FGMs showed no difference between rutting
   season and non-reproductive season, but vigilance was lowest in the
   rutting season. FGMs correlated with vigilance frequency and vigilance
   duration. Antipredator responses of female Przewalski's gazelles appear
   to change with reproductive status but not with group size in
   free-ranging females. Management measures should be taken in the lambing
   season to minimize stress on mother gazelles.},

   the common toad during the breeding period},

Abstract = {Artificial nocturnal lighting, a worldwide phenomenon that is currently
   expanding, experimentally reduces the duration of activity and increases
   oxygen consumption at rest of the common toad, a nocturnal amphibian.
   These behavioural and physiological changes could be associated with an
   increase in individual stress levels and thus affect toad populations.
   Abstract The presence of artificial light at night (ALAN) is currently a
   global phenomenon. By altering the photoperiod, ALAN may directly affect
   the physiology and behaviour of many organisms, such as the timing of
   daily rhythms, hormonal regulation, food intake, metabolism, migration
   and reproduction. Surprisingly while it is known that ALAN exposure
   strongly influences health of humans and laboratory animals, studies on
   wildlife remain scarce. Amphibians are one of the most nocturnal groups
   of vertebrates and exhibit an unfavourable conservation status in most
   parts of the world. In order to gain insight into the consequences of
   ALAN, we experimentally exposed 36 adult breeding male common toads,
   Bufo bufo, to a light intensity of 0.1, 5 or 20 lux for 20 days, to
   investigate the activity using infrared cameras and the whole-body
   oxygen consumption by respirometry, as well as body mass and food
   intake. ALAN reduced toad activity over 24 h by 56\% at 5 lux and by
   73\% at 20 lux. It did not affect the total energy expenditure but
   altered energy allocation. Indeed, standard energy expenditure increased
   by 28\% at 5 lux and by 58\% at 20 lux, while activity energy
   expenditure decreased by 18\% at 5 lux and 38\% at 20 lux. Finally, body
   mass and food intake were not affected. This study suggests that ALAN
   plays a large role in the activity and energy metabolism of common
   toads, which may have a long-term negative effect on the fitness of
   common toad populations. Generalizing these results to other taxa is
   crucial for conservation of biodiversity in an increasingly light world.},

Title = {Endocrine responses to diverse stressors of Capture, entanglement and
   stranding in leatherback turtles (<i>Dermochelys</i> <i>coriacea</i>)},

Abstract = {Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) are exposed to many
   anthropogenic stressors, yet almost no data on stress physiology exist
   for this species. As a first step toward understanding the physiological
   responses of leatherback turtles to stress, and with the particular goal
   of assessment of the effect of capture, we quantified corticosterone (an
   adrenal stress hormone) and thyroxine (a regulator of metabolic rate,
   often inhibited by chronic stress) in 17 healthy leatherback turtles
   captured at sea for scientific study, with comparisons to 15
   `distressed' leatherbacks that were found entangled in fishing gear (n =
   8), confined in a weir net (n = 1) or stranded on shore (n = 6).
   Distressed leatherbacks had significantly elevated corticosterone (mean
   +/- SEM 10.05 +/- 1.72 ng/ml, median 8.38 ng/ml) and free thyroxine
   (mean 0.86 +/- 0.37 pg/ml, median 0.08 pg/ml) compared with healthy
   leatherbacks sampled immediately before release (after similar to 40 min
   of handling; corticosterone, mean 4.97 +/- 0.62 ng/ml, median 5.21
   ng/ml; and free thyroxine, mean 0.05 +/- 0.05 pg/ml, median 0.00 pg/ml).
   The elevated thyroxine in distressed turtles compared with healthy
   turtles might indicate an energetic burden of entanglement and
   stranding. Six of the healthy leatherbacks were sampled twice, at
   similar to 25 and similar to 50 min after the time of first disturbance.
   In all six individuals, corticosterone was higher in the later sample
   (earlier sample, mean 2.74 +/- 0.88 ng/ml, median 2.61 ng/ml; later
   sample, mean 5.43 +/- 1.29 ng/ml, median 5.38 ng/ml), indicating that
   capture and handling elicit an adrenal stress response in this species.
   However, the corticosterone elevation after capture appeared relatively
   mild compared with the corticosterone concentrations of the entangled
   and stranded turtles. The findings suggest that capture and handling
   using the protocols described (e.g. capture duration <1 h) might
   represent only a mild stressor, whereas entanglement and stranding might
   represent moderate to severe stressors.},

Title = {Stress physiology of migrant birds during stopover in natural and
   anthropogenic woodland habitats of the Northern Prairie region},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic alterations of woodland habitat may influence stopover
   biology, which in turn could alter the stress physiology of migratory
   landbirds. Woodland stopover habitats are scarce in the Northern Prairie
   region of North America and consist of native riparian corridor
   woodlands (corridors) and smaller, more isolated woodlots of
   anthropogenic origin around farmsteads (woodlots). Corridor habitats
   have been greatly reduced since the time of European settlement, but
   woodlot habitats have appeared over this same time period. In this
   study, we compared stopover biology and stress physiology of migratory
   landbirds using natural and anthropogenic woodland habitats. We first
   tested for differences between birds in the two habitats for baseline
   corticosterone (CORTB) and the magnitude of the stress response for
   individual species, taxonomic families and foraging guilds. Plasma
   corticosterone increased significantly for all bird groups in both
   habitats following 30 min of restraint stress (CORT30), and neither
   CORTB nor the magnitude of the stress response (CORT30 - CORTB) differed
   significantly between birds in the two habitats. Secondly, because CORTB
   levels are often elevated and CORT secretion following a stressor is
   often suppressed for birds in poor body condition, we hypothesized that
   woodland migrants with higher fattening rates would show reduced CORTB
   and a robust stress response. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the
   relationships between plasma corticosterone and plasma metabolites
   associated with refuelling. We found that CORTB was negatively
   associated and the magnitude of the stress response positively
   associated with plasma triglycerides (an indicator of fat deposition),
   with opposite patterns for corticosterone and plasma
   beta-hydroxybutyrate (an indicator of fat catabolism). These data
   suggest that both corridor and woodlot habitats serve as effective
   stopover habitat and that the reduction of corridor habitat and
   increased reliance on anthropogenic woodlots is not detrimental to the
   stress physiology of migrants in a region with limited woodland
   habitats.},

Abstract = {Measurement of cortisol in fish scales is attracting considerable
   attention as a non-invasive indicator of chronic stress in wild
   populations. For many fish species of management and conservation
   interest, extensive scale collections exist that could provide extended
   records of individual stress responses, by combining cortisol
   measurements with life history information. However, it is not yet known
   how well cortisol is preserved in the scale during storage. To
   investigate the stability of scale cortisol, we accelerated potential
   degradation by storing scales from an individual farmed Atlantic salmon
   (Salmo salar) in an oven at 50 degrees C for between 2 and 12 weeks. We
   found no significant relationship between scale cortisol concentration
   and either storage time or storage temperature. Cortisol concentrations
   in scales from the same fish were consistent (18.54-21.82 ng. g-1;
   coefficient of variation (CV) = 3.6\%), indicating that scale cortisol
   can be reliably quantified, even in scales stored for varying periods of
   time or under different conditions. We also examined the effects of
   storage in real time using Atlantic salmon scales that were stored in
   paper envelopes at room temperature for between 3 and 32 years and found
   no significant relationship between scale cortisol concentration and
   storage time. Scale cortisol concentrations ranged from 4.05 to 135.37
   ng.g-1 and levels of between-individual variability were high (CV =
   61\%). Given that scale cortisol does not degrade during long-term
   storage, historical scale collections and associated data describing
   fish life histories could potentially be used to develop bioindicators
   of physiological responses in fish populations. Further research is
   needed to understand scale cortisol variability and its biological
   relevance.
   Cortisol in fish scales could provide a non-invasive indicator of
   chronic stress in wild populations. We show that scale cortisol does not
   degrade during storage (3-32 years) or when held at 50 degrees C to
   accelerate potential degradation. Therefore, the scale collections held
   by many fisheries organizations and museums can be reliably analysed for
   cortisol.},

Abstract = {Moose populations in the northeastern United States have declined over
   the past 15 years, primarily due to the impacts of winter ticks.
   Research efforts have focused on the effects of winter tick infestation
   on moose survival and reproduction, but stress and nutritional responses
   to ticks and other stressors remain understudied. We examined the
   influence of several environmental factors on moose calf stress hormone
   metabolite concentrations and nutritional restriction in Vermont, USA.
   We collected 407 fecal and 461 snowurine samples from84 radio-collared
   moose calves in the winters of 2017-2019 (JanuaryApril) to measure fecal
   glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCM) concentrations and urea
   nitrogen:creatinine (UN:C) ratios. We used generalized mixed-effects
   models to evaluate the influence of individual condition, winter ticks,
   habitat, climate and human development on stress and nutrition in calf
   moose. We then used these physiological data to build generalized linear
   models to predict calf winter survival. CalffGCMconcentrations increased
   with nutritional restriction and snowdepth during adult winter tick
   engorgement. Calf UN:C ratios increased in calves with lighterweights
   and higher tick loads in early winter. Calf UN:C ratios also increased
   in individuals with home ranges composed of little deciduous forests
   during adult winter tick engorgement. Our predictive models estimated
   that winter survival was negatively related to UN:C ratios and
   positively related to fGCM concentrations, particularly in early winter.
   By late March, as winter ticks are having their greatest toll and
   endogenous resources become depleted, we estimated a curvilinear
   relationship between fGCM concentrations and survival. Our results
   provide novel evidence linking moose calf stress and nutrition, a
   problematic parasite and challenging environment and winter survival.
   Our findings provide a baseline to support the development of
   non-invasive physiological monitoring for assessing environmental
   impacts on moose populations.},

Title = {Artificial light at night does not alter heart rate or locomotor
   behaviour in Caribbean spiny lobster (<i>Panulirus argus</i>): insights
   into light pollution and physiological disturbance using biologgers},

Abstract = {Light pollution is a rapidly growing threat to biodiversity, with many
   unknown or poorly understood effects on species and ecosystems spanning
   terrestrial and aquatic environments. Relative to other taxa, the
   effects of artificial light at night on aquatic invertebrates are poorly
   understood, despite the abundance and integral significance of
   invertebrates to marine and freshwater ecosystems. We affixed heart rate
   and acceleration biologgers to adult Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus
   argus), an ecologically, culturally and economically significant species
   in the western Atlantic ocean, to test the effect of artificial light at
   night on this species'physiology and behaviour relative to appropriate
   controls. The experiment was conducted in a simulated reef mesocosm in
   The Bahamas with incandescent lighting used to illuminate it at 1 lux,
   approximating light levels offshore of urban areas. In the conditions
   tested here, artificial light at night was found to have no effect on
   heart rate or locomotor activity in P. argus. We observed a dissociation
   between activity and heart rate at both short-term and long-term
   temporal scales. Lobsters were more active at night and nocturnal
   activity was higher in trials closer to new moon; however, heart rate
   did not vary with diel or lunar cycle. There was less than 8\%
   difference between daytime and night time average heart rate despite the
   average percentage of time spent active almost tripling in nights versus
   days, to 19.5\% from 7.2\%, respectively. Our findings suggest P. argus
   may have some resilience to low levels of light pollution, which
   warrants further research on aspects of this species' life history,
   performance and fitness in the face of this potential anthropogenic
   disturbance.},

Abstract = {Wildlife populations are increasingly exposed to human-induced
   modifications of their habitats. To cope with anthropogenic stressors,
   animals can adjust their behaviour-for example, by shifting their
   activity to more sheltered habitats, or becoming more nocturnal.
   However, whether use of spatial and temporal adjustments in behaviour
   may regulate the endocrine response is poorly documented. Here, we
   analyzed faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) of wild roe deer (Capreolus
   capreolus) living in a human-dominated agro-ecosystem. Using Global
   Positioning System monitoring of 116 individuals, we assessed their
   spatial behaviour and tested whether proximity to anthropogenic
   structures (linear distance to built-up areas) and the use of refuge
   habitats (woodland and hedges) influenced FCM levels. In accordance with
   our predictions, individuals ranging closer to anthropogenic structures
   during daytime had higher FCM levels, but this relationship was buffered
   as use of refuge habitat increased. In addition, this link between
   proximity to anthropogenic structures and FCM levels disappeared when we
   analyzed spatial behaviour at night. Finally, FCM levels were higher
   when the ambient temperature was lower, and during years of low resource
   availability. Our results demonstrate that the stress levels of large
   mammals may be strongly influenced by their proximity to anthropogenic
   activities, but that these effects may be buffered by behavioural
   adjustments in terms of space use and circadian rhythm. Whereas most
   studies have focused on the influence of environmental heterogeneity,
   our analysis highlights the need to also consider the fine-scale spatial
   response of individuals when studying the hormonal response of wild
   animals to human disturbance. We emphasize the potential to mitigate
   this hormonal stress response, and its potential negative consequences
   on population dynamics, through the preservation or restoration of
   patches of refuge habitat in close proximity to human infrastructure.},

Title = {Oxidative stress predicts long-term resight probability and reproductive
   success in Scopoli's shearwater (<i>Calonectris diomedea</i>)},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},

Abstract = {A major challenge in conservation physiology is to find out biomarkers
   that reliably reflect individual variation in wear and tear. Recent work
   has suggested that biomarkers of oxidative stress may provide an
   additional tool to assess the health state of individuals and to predict
   fitness perspectives. In this study, we assessed whether three
   biomarkers of plasma oxidative status predicted the following factors:
   (i) the resight probability as breeder in the next seasons; and (ii) the
   cumulative reproductive output over multiple years in Scopoli's
   shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) using a 7 year individual-based data
   set. Our results show that shearwaters having higher levels of a marker
   of oxidative damage (reactive oxygen metabolites) in 2008 had a lower
   resight probability in the next years and a lower number of chicks
   raised from 2008 to 2014. In contrast, two biomarkers of antioxidant
   defences (non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity of plasma and thiols) did
   not have any predictive value. Increased concentrations of plasma
   reactive oxygen metabolites, together with the significant individual
   repeatability over time in this metric of oxidative stress found in
   numerous studies, suggest that this metric might serve as a
   blood-derived biomarker for health and fitness perspectives in birds
   and, possibly, also in other taxa.},

Title = {Does environmental stress affect cortisol biodistribution in freshwater
   mussels?},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 8},
Abstract = {As of today, regulation and physiological purpose of steroid hormones in
   invertebrates such as mussels are not completely understood. Many
   studies were able to show their presence, but their origin and genesis
   are not clear. Nevertheless, knowledge about changes in steroid hormone
   biodistribution in reaction to treatments could improve our
   understanding of their physiological functions in these species.
   Cortisol is a corticosteroid, which is frequently used as a stress
   biomarker in vertebrates, like fish or higher organisms. The aim of the
   study was to optimize cortisol extraction from various tissues of
   mussels, to develop a quantitative ELISA test system, and to study
   changes in biodistribution of cortisol in reaction to negative and
   positive stimulation treatments. As model organism, we used Anodonta
   anatina, a widespread freshwater mussel species native to Europe. We
   quantified cortisol concentrations in hepatopancreas, mantle, gills,
   gonads and the foot muscle. Tissue-specific reactions to environmental
   influences, simulated with the chemical stressors copper (II) chloride
   and sodium chloride, were assessed. During the 24-hours treatment, we
   additionally observed changes in cortisol regulation in response to
   feeding activity of the mussels. Besides, we found highly significant
   variations in the biodistribution of cortisol in different tissues, with
   a peak in the hepatopancreas. Whole body cortisol did not increase in
   the treated groups. However, balancing of all measured tissues showed
   redistribution of more than 10\% of total body cortisol from the
   hepatopancreas to all other tissues during copper (II) chloride stressor
   treatment, but also when mussels ingested feed, compared to the non-fed
   control group. No redistribution was observed during sodium chloride
   treatment. We conclude that there can be a redistribution of cortisol in
   mussels, depending on external influences.},

Abstract = {Body condition indices and related metrics can help assess habitat
   quality and other ecological processes, and ideally, these metrics are
   based on measures of lipids directly extracted from the species of
   interest. In recent decades, barred owls (Strix varia) have become a
   species of conservation concern as they invaded older forests of the US
   Pacific Northwest, and caused population declines of the closely related
   and federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis
   caurina). A simple and effective measure of barred owl body condition
   could help to understand how habitat quality varies within their new
   range, which in turn can inform their management and other aspects of
   their ecology. Using 77 barred owl carcasses collected during
   experimental removals in Washington and Oregon, USA, we measured the
   amount of lipid in each specimen with proximate body composition
   analysis. We then fit and compared (with adjusted R2 values) alternative
   linear regression models to estimate the percent lipids in dry mass of
   the owls based on morphometric body condition indices, a qualitative fat
   score of subcutaneous breast fat, sex and the time of year females were
   collected (relative to egg production). Adjusted R2 values for all
   models ranged from 0.49 to 0.87, with the best model including mass
   divided by foot-pad length, fat score, sex and the time of year a female
   was collected. Most models generated comparable estimates of percent
   lipids at a population level and we provided correction factors to apply
   these models when used with live barred owls, allowing for site-specific
   comparisons of body condition among individuals inhabiting a diversity
   of environmental conditions.},

Title = {Tools for the <i>ex situ</i> conservation of the threatened species,
   <i>Cycladenia humilis</i> var. <i>jonesii</i>},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {Ex situ conservation is critical for hedging against the loss of plant
   diversity. For those species (exceptional species) that cannot be
   conserved long-term in standard seed banks, alternative methods are
   required, often involving in vitro culture and cryopreservation, or
   storage in liquid nitrogen. Cycladenia humilis var. jonesii is a
   federally threatened perennial native to Utah and Arizona. It is
   classified as an exceptional species, because it produces few seeds,
   and, thus, in vitro propagation and cryopreservation were investigated
   as tools for its propagation and preservation. Shoot-propagating
   cultures were established from both seedling and wild-collected shoots,
   but cultures from both sources displayed an extreme form of the
   physiological disorder, hyperhydricity. This phenotype could be at least
   partially normalized by the use of vented closures, as well as by using
   agar, rather than gellan gum, in the medium. The hyperhydric (HH)
   phenotype had a lower dry weight, more branching, minimal leaf
   development and more poorly developed vascular tissue than the more
   normal (MN) phenotype. Only more normalized shoots could be rooted and
   the resulting plants acclimatized. Both HH and MN shoots also provided
   shoot tips capable of surviving cryopreservation using the droplet
   vitrification method. These in vitro and cryopreservation methods
   provide tools that can be used for propagating plants of C. humilis var.
   jonesii for research and restoration, as well as for supplying shoot
   tips for the ex situ conservation of this species. The two distinct
   phenotypes also provide a useful system for studying factors involved in
   the HH response of this dryland species in vitro.},

Title = {Reproductive phases coincide with changes in morphology and
   photosynthetic physiology in an endangered cycad species},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Cycadales is highly endangered and one of the oldest dioecious
   gymnosperm lineages, making their reproductive biology highly relevant
   to conservation efforts and our understanding of the impact of dioecy,
   yet cycad reproductive ecophysiology is poorly understood. We examined
   how the costs associated with reproduction may impact basic
   physiological variation in cycad species. Specifically, we measured
   traits related to functional morphology and photosynthetic physiology in
   sterile and fertile staminate plants ('males') of Zamia portoricensis.
   Light response curves showed that sterile plants had greater light-use
   efficiency and maximum photosynthetic capacity per area compared with
   fertile plants. However, fertile and sterile plants exhibited similar
   respiration rates. We found significantly more nitrogen in leaves of
   fertile individuals, but similar nitrogen isotope composition and no
   differences in carbon content between sterile and fertile individuals.
   Despite having lower leaf-level photosynthetic rates, fertile plants had
   greater canopy-level photosynthesis than sterile plants, which was
   achieved by increasing leaf number and total leaf area. Our data suggest
   that sterile individuals may have greater light demands relative to
   fertile individuals, and fertile individuals may have greater nitrogen
   demands, which may be critical for successful reproductive events in
   staminate plants of the endangered cycad, Z. portoricensis.
   Cycadales is nominally the most endangered plant group on Earth, yet so
   much of their basic biology remains unknown which limits conservation
   strategies. We examined how key aspects of plant function may change
   with reproductive status in a tropical endangered cycad. We found that
   sterile individuals may have greater light demands relative to fertile
   individuals, and fertile individuals may have greater nitrogen demands,
   which may be critical for successful reproductive events in this
   endangered cycad.},

Title = {Blood gases, biochemistry and haematology of Galapagos hawksbill turtles
   (<i>Eretmochelys imbricata</i>)},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The hawksbill turtle, Eretmochelys imbricata, is a marine chelonian with
   a circum-global distribution, but the species is critically endangered
   and has nearly vanished from the eastern Pacific. Although reference
   blood parameter intervals have been published for many chelonian species
   and populations, including nesting Atlantic hawksbills, no such baseline
   biochemical and blood gas values have been reported for wild Pacific
   hawksbill turtles. Blood samples were drawn from eight hawksbill turtles
   captured in near shore foraging locations within the Galapagos
   archipelago over a period of four sequential years; three of these
   turtles were recaptured and sampled on multiple occasions. Of the eight
   sea turtles sampled, five were immature and of unknown sex, and the
   other three were females. A portable blood analyzer was used to obtain
   near immediate field results for a suite of blood gas and chemistry
   parameters. Values affected by temperature were corrected in two ways:
   (i) with standard formulas and (ii) with auto-corrections made by the
   portable analyzer. A bench top blood chemistry analyzer was used to
   measure a series of biochemistry parameters from plasma. Standard
   laboratory haematology techniques were employed for red and white blood
   cell counts and to determine haematocrit manually, which was compared to
   the haematocrit values generated by the portable analyzer. The values
   reported in this study provide reference data that may be useful in
   comparisons among populations and in detecting changes in health status
   among Galapagos sea turtles. The findings might also be helpful in
   future efforts to demonstrate associations between specific biochemical
   parameters and disease or environmental disasters.},

Abstract = {We defined the reference intervals for blood parameters of giant pandas.
   This is the first study to reveal changes in blood parameters in giant
   pandas in response to changes in elevation. These data help us to plan
   reintroduction of captive born giant pandas.
   Physiological indexes like blood parameters have been widely used to
   monitor the health of free-roaming animals. Attempts to reintroduce one
   of China's most endangered species, the giant panda (Ailuropoda
   melanoleuca), have been hampered by a lack of data on its ecology and
   physiology. We examined three giant pandas' hematological and blood
   chemistry parameters in a soft release program and 30 captive giant
   pandas as controls and determined the reference intervals (RIs) for
   those blood parameters in the captive animals. Elevation, captivity
   status and the interaction of those factors were statistically
   significant for hematologic measures. Release pandas had significantly
   higher hemoglobin and hematocrit values after they moved to high
   elevation locations. We also found significant difference in the enzyme
   parameters between high and low elevation pandas such as higher
   aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine kinase,
   amylase and lower lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase.
   Release pandas also had higher nutrition parameter values such as higher
   albumin, globulin and creatinine. The RI for blood parameters in our
   study provides a baseline to monitor the health of captive animals and
   forms the basis for assessing the health of free-roaming giant pandas in
   future reintroduction efforts.},

Abstract = {Maternal diet affects reproductive output in female freshwater turtles
   (Emydura macquarii). At wetlands where filamentous green algae are
   scarce and turtles are functionally carnivorous, females produce smaller
   clutches. Reduced clutch size associated with food availability may have
   implications for declining freshwater turtle species.
   Food availability determines the amount of energy animals can acquire
   and allocate to reproduction and other necessary functions. Female
   animals that are food limited thus experience reduced energy available
   for reproduction. When this occurs, females may reduce frequency of
   reproductive events or the number or size of offspring per reproductive
   bout. We assessed how maternal diet affects reproductive output in adult
   female Murray River short-necked turtles, Emydura macquarii, from four
   wetlands in Victoria. We previously found that turtle diets differ in
   the composition of plants and animals between our study wetlands. In
   this study, we tested whether differences in turtle diet composition
   (i.e. plants and animals) at these wetlands were associated with
   differences in clutch mass, individual egg mass, bulk egg composition
   and hatching success. We found total clutch mass increased with maternal
   body size at each site. At sites where filamentous green algae were
   scarce and E. macquarii were carnivorous, females produced smaller
   clutches relative to body size compared to females from sites where
   algae were abundant, and turtles were more herbivorous. Individual egg
   mass, bulk egg composition and hatching success did not differ across
   wetlands. Isotopic analysis revealed significant positive relationships
   between the carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta 13C, delta 15N) of the
   eggs and those of the mothers, indicating that mothers allocated ratios
   of carbon and nitrogen isotopes to their eggs similar to those present
   in their tissues. Our study suggests that at sites where females are
   more carnivorous due to a relative absence of algae, females produce
   smaller clutches, but other aspects of their reproduction are not
   significantly impacted. The reduction in clutch size associated with
   differences in the availability of dietary plants and animals may have
   long-term consequences for E. macquarii and other freshwater turtle
   species that are experiencing population declines.},

Title = {Temporal vs. spatial variation in stress-associated metabolites within a
   population of climate-sensitive small mammals},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {Temporal variation in stress might signify changes in an animal's
   internal or external environment, while spatial variation in stress
   might signify variation in the quality of the habitats that individual
   animals experience. Habitat-induced variations in stress might be
   easiest to detect in highly territorial animals, and especially in
   species that do not take advantage of common strategies for modulating
   habitat-induced stress, such as migration (escape in space) or
   hibernation (escape in time). Spatial and temporal variation in response
   to potential stressors has received little study in wild animals,
   especially at scales appropriate for relating stress to specific habitat
   characteristics. Here, we use the American pika (Ochotona princeps), a
   territorial small mammal, to investigate stress response within and
   among territories. For individually territorial animals such as pikas,
   differences in habitat quality should lead to differences in stress
   exhibited by territory owners. We indexed stress using stress-associated
   hormone metabolites in feces collected non-invasively from pika
   territories every 2 weeks from June to September 2018. We hypothesized
   that differences in territory quality would lead to spatial differences
   in mean stress and that seasonal variation in physiology or the physical
   environment would lead to synchronous variation across territories
   through time. We used linear mixed-effects models to explore
   spatiotemporal variation in stress using fixed effects of day-of-year
   and broad habitat characteristics (elevation, aspect, site), as well as
   local variation in habitat characteristics hypothesized to affect
   territory quality for this saxicolous species (talus depth, clast size,
   available forage types). We found that temporal variation within
   territories was greater than spatial variation among territories,
   suggesting that shared seasonal stressors are more influential than
   differences in individual habitat quality. This approach could be used
   in other wildlife studies to refine our understanding of habitat quality
   and its effect on individual stress levels as a driver of population
   decline.},

Title = {The effects of daily mitotane or diazepam treatment on the formation of
   chronic stress symptoms in newly captured wild house sparrows},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 29},
Abstract = {Wild animals brought into captivity frequently experience chronic stress
   and typically need a period of time to adjust to the conditions of
   captivity (restraint, artificial lighting, altered diet, human presence,
   etc.), to which theymay never fully acclimate. Changes in mass, the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and heart rate parameters have been
   observed over the first week in newly captive house sparrows (Passer
   domesticus). In this study, we tested the effects of two drugs, diazepam
   and mitotane, in preventing the chronic stress symptoms caused by
   captivity, compared with oil-injected control animals. Diazepam is an
   anxiolytic that is widely prescribed in humans and other animals and has
   been shown in some cases to reduce physiological stress. Mitotane is an
   agent that causes chemical adrenalectomy, reducing the body's capacity
   to produce glucocorticoid hormones. Our mitotane treatment did not cause
   the expected change in corticosterone concentrations. Baseline
   corticosterone was higher after a week in captivity regardless of the
   treatment group, while stress-induced corticosterone did not
   significantly increase above baseline after a week in captivity in any
   treatment group. However, mitotane treatment did have some physiological
   effects, as it reduced the resting heart rate and the duration of the
   heart rate response to a sudden noise. It also prevented the increase in
   nighttime activity that we observed in control animals. There was no
   effect of diazepam on corticosterone, resting heart rate, activity or
   heart rate response to a sudden noise, and no effect of either treatment
   on the sympathetic vs parasympathetic control of the resting heart rate.
   Together, these data suggest that mitotane, but not diazepam, can have a
   modest impact on helping house sparrows adapt to captive conditions.
   Easing the transition to captivity will likely make conservation
   efforts, such as initiating captive breeding programs, more successful.},

Title = {Effects of sound exposure from a seismic airgun on heart rate,
   acceleration and depth use in free-swimming Atlantic cod and saithe},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Airguns used for offshore seismic exploration by the oil and gas
   industry contribute to globally increasing anthropogenic noise levels in
   the marine environment. There is concern that the omnidirectional, high
   intensity sound pulses created by airguns may alter fish physiology and
   behaviour. A controlled short-term field experiment was performed to
   investigate the effects of sound exposure from a seismic airgun on the
   physiology and behaviour of two socioeconomically and ecologically
   important marine fishes: the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe
   (Pollachius virens). Biologgers recording heart rate and body
   temperature and acoustic transmitters recording locomotory activity
   (i.e. acceleration) and depth were used to monitor free-swimming
   individuals during experimental sound exposures (18-60 dB above
   ambient). Fish were held in a large sea cage (50 m diameter; 25 m depth)
   and exposed to sound exposure trials over a 3-day period. Concurrently,
   the behaviour of untagged cod and saithe was monitored using video
   recording. The cod exhibited reduced heart rate (bradycardia) in
   response to the particle motion component of the sound from the airgun,
   indicative of an initial flight response. No behavioural startle
   response to the airgun was observed; both cod and saithe changed both
   swimming depth and horizontal position more frequently during sound
   production. The saithe became more dispersed in response to the elevated
   sound levels. The fish seemed to habituate both physiologically and
   behaviourally with repeated exposure. In conclusion, the sound exposures
   induced over the time frames used in this study appear unlikely to be
   associated with long-term alterations in physiology or behaviour.
   However, additional research is needed to fully understand the
   ecological consequences of airgun use in marine ecosystems.},

Title = {Coping with differences in snow cover: the impact on the condition,

Abstract = {The Earth's climate is changing at an unprecedented rate and, as
   ecologists, we are challenged with the difficult task of predicting how
   individuals and populations will respond to climate-induced changes to
   local and global ecosystems. Although we are beginning to understand
   some of the responses to changing seasonality, the physiological
   mechanisms that may drive these responses remain unknown. Using
   long-term data comparing two nearby populations (<20 km apart) of
   free-living arctic ground squirrels in northern Alaska, we have
   previously shown that the timing of spring snowmelt greatly influences
   their phenology of hibernation and reproduction in a population and
   site-specific manner. Here, we integrate these site-specific phenologies
   with body condition, stress physiology, reproductive success and
   juvenile recruitment to understand phenotypic selection in the two
   populations. We found that at the site with relatively late spring
   snowmelt and early autumn snow cover: (i) adult females were larger and
   in better body condition but had significantly higher stress hormone
   levels; (ii) females had similar numbers of comparably sized offspring,
   but offspring had higher stress hormone levels; and (iii) offspring
   density was lower just prior to hibernation. Thus, adult females at the
   two sites appear to use different coping strategies that allow them to
   maintain reproductive fitness; however, marked shortening of the active
   season because of later snowmelt in spring and earlier snow cover in
   autumn may compromise juvenile recruitment. We discuss the significance
   of these findings within the broader context of changing
   animal-environment relationships.},

Abstract = {It has been proposed that we are now living in a new geological epoch
   known as the Anthropocene, which is specifically defined by the impacts
   that humans are having on the Earth's biological diversity and geology.
   Although the proposal of this term was borne out of an acknowledgement
   of the negative changes we are imparting on the globe (e.g. climate
   change, pollution, coastal erosion, species extinctions), there has
   recently been action amongst a variety of disciplines aimed at achieving
   a `good Anthropocene' that strives to balance societal needs and the
   preservation of the natural world. Here, we outline ways that the
   discipline of conservation physiology can help to delineate a hopeful,
   progressive and productive path for conservation in the Anthropocene
   and, specifically, achieve that vision. We focus on four primary ways
   that conservation physiology can contribute, as follows: (i) building a
   proactive approach to conservation; (ii) encouraging a pragmatic
   perspective; (iii) establishing an appreciation for environmental
   resilience; and (iv) informing and engaging the public and political
   arenas. As a collection of passionate individuals combining theory,
   technological advances, public engagement and a dedication to achieving
   conservation success, conservation physiologists are poised to make
   meaningful contributions to the productive, motivational and positive
   way forward that is necessary to curb and reverse negative human impact
   on the environment.},

Title = {Physiological reactions to capture in hibernating brown bears},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Human disturbance can affect animal life history and even population
   dynamics. However, the consequences of these disturbances are difficult
   to measure. This is especially true for hibernating animals, which are
   highly vulnerable to disturbance, because hibernation is a process of
   major physiological changes, involving conservation of energy during a
   resource-depleted time of year. During the winters of 2011-15, we
   captured 15 subadult brown bears (Ursus arctos) and recorded their body
   temperatures (n = 11) and heart rates (n = 10) before, during and after
   capture using biologgers. We estimated the time for body temperature and
   heart rate to normalize after the capture event. We then evaluated the
   effect of the captures on the pattern and depth of hibernation and the
   day of den emergence by comparing the body temperature of captured bears
   with that of undisturbed subadult bears (n = 11). Both body temperature
   and heart rate increased during capture and returned to hibernation
   levels after 15-20 days. We showed that bears required 2-3 weeks to
   return to hibernation levels after winter captures, suggesting high
   metabolic costs during this period. There were also indications that the
   winter captures resulted in delayed den emergence.},

Title = {Biomonitors of atmospheric nitrogen deposition: potential uses and
   limitations},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAR 13},
Abstract = {Atmospheric nitrogen deposition is the third largest cause of global
   biodiversity loss, with rates that have more than doubled over the past
   century. This is especially threatening for tropical regions where the
   deposition may soon exceed 25 kg of N ha(-1) year(-1), well above the
   threshold for physiological damage of 12-20 kg of N ha(-1) year(-1),
   depending on plant species and nitrogenous compound. It is thus urgent
   to monitor these regions where the most diverse biotas occur. However,
   most studies have been conducted in Europe, the USA and recently in
   China. This review presents the case for the potential use of biological
   organisms to monitor nitrogen deposition, with emphasis on tropical
   plants. We first present an overview of atmospheric chemistry and the
   nitrogen metabolism of potential biomonitors, followed by a framework
   for monitoring nitrogen deposition based on the simultaneous use of
   various functional groups. In particular, the tissue nitrogen content
   responds to the rate of deposition, especially for mosses, whose
   nitrogen content increases by 1\% per kilogram of N ha(-1) year(-1). The
   isotopic signature, delta N-15, is a useful indicator of the nitrogen
   source, as the slightly negative values (e.g. 5\%) of plants from
   natural environments can become very negative (-11.2\%) in sites with
   agricultural and husbandry activities, but very positive (13.3\%) in
   urban environments with high vehicular activity. Mosses are good
   biomonitors for wet deposition and atmospheric epiphytes for dry
   deposition. In turn, the nitrogen saturation of ecosystems can be
   monitored with trees whose isotopic values increase with saturation.
   Although given ecophysiological limitations of different organisms,
   particular studies should be conducted in each area of interest to
   determine the most suitable biomonitors. Overall, biomonitors can
   provide an integrative approach for characterizing nitrogen deposition
   in regions where the deployment of automated instruments or passive
   monitoring is not feasible or can be complementary.},

Abstract = {Human-generated noise has profoundly changed natural soundscapes in
   aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, imposing novel pressures on
   ecological processes. Despite interest in identifying the ecological
   consequences of these altered soundscapes, little is known about the
   sublethal impacts on wildlife population health and individual fitness.
   We present evidence that noise induces a physiological stress response
   in an amphibian and impairs mate attraction in the natural environment.
   Traffic noise increased levels of a stress-relevant glucocorticoid
   hormone (corticosterone) in female wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus)
   and impaired female travel towards a male breeding chorus in the field,
   providing insight into the sublethal consequences of acoustic habitat
   loss. Given that prolonged elevated levels of corticosterone can have
   deleterious consequences on survival and reproduction and that impaired
   mate attraction can impact population persistence, our results suggest a
   novel pathway by which human activities may be imposing population-level
   impacts on globally declining amphibians.},

Title = {Steroid hormones in Pacific walrus bones collected over three millennia
   indicate physiological responses to changes in estimated population size
   and the environment},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 19},
Abstract = {The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) is an iconic Arctic
   marine mammal and an important resource to many Alaska Natives. A
   decrease in sea ice habitat and unknown population numbers has led to
   concern of the long-term future health of the walrus population. There
   is currently no clear understanding of how walrus physiology might be
   affected by a changing Arctic ecosystem. In this study, steroid hormone
   concentrations (progesterone, testosterone, cortisol and estradiol) were
   analysed in walrus bones collected during archaeological {[}3585-200
   calendar years before present (BP)], historical {[}1880-2006 common era
   (CE)] and modern (2014-2016 CE) time periods, representing similar to
   3651 years, to track changes in reproductive activity and cortisol
   concentrations (biomarker of stress) over time. Our results show that
   modern walrus samples have similar cortisol concentrations (median =
   43.97 +/- standard deviation 904.38 ng/g lipid) to archaeological
   walruses (38.94 +/- 296.17 ng/g lipid, P = 0.75). Cortisol
   concentrations were weakly correlated with a 15-year average September
   Chukchi Sea ice cover (P= 0.002, 0.02, r(2) = 0.09, 0.04, for females
   and males, respectively), indicating a possible physiological resiliency
   to sea ice recession in the Arctic. All steroid hormones had significant
   negative correlations with mean walrus population estimates from 1960 to
   2016 (P < 0.001). Progesterone in females and testosterone in males
   exhibited significant correlations with average September Chukchi Sea
   ice cover for years 1880-2016 (P < 0.001 for both, r(2) = 0.34, 0.22,
   respectively). Modern walruses had significantly lower (P = < 0.001)
   reproductive hormone concentrations compared with historic walruses
   during times of rapid population increase, indicative of a population
   possibly at carrying capacity. This is the first study to apply bone as
   a tool to monitor long-term changes in hormones that may be associated
   with changes in walrus population size and sea ice cover.},

Title = {Physiological and behavioural responses of moose to hunting with dogs},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 30},
Abstract = {Optimal management of hunted species requires an understanding of the
   impacts of hunting on both individual animal and population levels.
   Recent technological advancements in biologging enable us to obtain
   increasingly detailed information fromfree-ranging animals, covering
   longer periods of time, and providing the data needed to assess such
   impacts. In Sweden, more than 80 000mooseare harvested annually, mostly
   huntedwith the use of baying dogs. The effects of this huntingmethod on
   animal welfare and stress are understudied. Here, we evaluated 6 real
   and 17 experimental hunting approaches with baying dogs {[}wearing
   global positioning system (GPS) collars] on 8 adult female moose
   equipped with ruminal temperature loggers, subcutaneous heart rate (HR)
   loggers and GPS collars with accelerometers. The obtained data were used
   to analyse the behavioural and physiological responses of moose to
   hunting with dogs. Successful experimental approaches (moose and dogwere
   within 240m for >10 min) resulted in higher maximum body temperature
   (Tb, 0.88.C higher) and a mean increase in HR of 24 bp min moose at the
   day of the approach compared to the day after. The moose rested on
   average >90 min longer the day after the approach compared to the day of
   the approach. The moose travelled on average 4.2 kmlonger and had a 1.3
   m/s higher maximum speed the day of the approach compared to the day
   after. Our results demonstrate that hunting with dogs increase moose
   energy expenditure and resting time (and consequently decrease time
   available for foraging) on an individual level. This could possibly
   affect body condition and reproduction rates if the hunting disturbances
   occur frequently.},

Title = {Hormone comparison between right and left baleen whale earplugs},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Marine animals experience additional stressors as humans continue to
   industrialize the oceans and as the climate continues to rapidly change.
   To examine how the environment or humans impact animal stress, many
   researchers analyse hormones from biological matrices. Scientists have
   begun to examine hormones in continuously growing biological matrices,
   such as baleen whale earwax plugs, baleen and pinniped vibrissae. Few of
   these studies have determined if the hormones in these tissues across
   the body of the organism are interchangeable. Here, hormone values in
   the right and left earplugs from the same individual were compared for
   two reasons: (i) to determine whether right and left earplug hormone
   values can be used interchangeably and (ii) to assess methods of
   standardizing hormones in right and left earplugs to control for
   individuals' naturally varying hormone expressions. We analysed how
   absolute, baseline-corrected and Z-score normalized hormones performed
   in reaching these goals. Absolute hormones in the right and left
   earplugs displayed a positive relationship, while using Z-score
   normalization was necessary to standardize the variance in hormone
   expression. After Z-score normalization, it was possible to show that
   the 95\% confidence intervals of the differences in corresponding lamina
   of the right and left earplugs include zero for both cortisol and
   progesterone. This indicates that the hormones in corresponding lamina
   of right and left earplugs are no different from zero.The results of
   this study reveal that both right and left earplugs from the same baleen
   whale can be used in hormone analyses after Z-score normalization. This
   study also shows the importance of Z-score normalization to
   interpretation of results and methodologies associated with analysing
   long-term trends using whale earplugs.},

   experimental displacement},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},

Abstract = {For Pacific salmon captured and released by fisheries, post-release
   behaviour and survival may be influenced by their health and condition
   at time of capture. We sought to characterize the interactions between
   infectious agent burden, fish immune and stress physiology and fisheries
   stressors to investigate the potential for capture-mediated
   pathogen-induced mortality in adult coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch. We
   used radio-telemetry paired with high-throughput qPCR of non-lethal gill
   biopsies for infectious agents and host biomarkers from 200 tagged fish
   experimentally displaced and exposed to various experimental fisheries
   treatments (gill net entanglement, recreational angling and recreational
   angling with air exposure vs. non-sampled control). We characterized
   relationships among post-release behaviour and survival, infectious
   agent presence and loads, physiological parameters and transcription
   profiles of stress and immune genes. All infectious agents detected were
   endemic and in loads consistent with previous adult Pacific salmon
   monitoring. Individuals exposed to fisheries treatments were less likely
   to reach spawning habitat compared to controls, and handling duration
   independent of fisheries gear had a negative effect on survival. High
   infectious agent burden was associated with accelerated migration
   initiation post-release, revealing behavioural plasticity in response to
   deteriorating condition in this semelparous species. Prevalence and load
   of infectious agents increased post-migration as well as transcription
   signatures reflected changes in immune and stress profiles consistent
   with senescence. Results from this study further our understanding of
   factors associated with fisheries that increase risk of post-release
   mortality and characterize some physiological mechanisms that underpin
   migratory behaviour.},

Title = {Normalized difference vegetation index, temperature and age affect
   faecal thyroid hormone concentrations in free-ranging African elephants},

Abstract = {Conservation biologists can use hormone measurements to assess animals'
   welfare, reproductive state, susceptibility to stressors, as well as
   energy expenditure. Quantifying hormone concentrations from faecal
   samples is particularly advantageous as samples can be collected without
   disturbing animals' behaviour. In order for an endocrine marker to be
   useful for wildlife managers, we need to understand how extrinsic and
   intrinsic factors affect hormone concentrations in free-ranging animal
   populations. Thyroid hormones are linked to basal metabolic rate and
   energy expenditure. Previous research demonstrated that triiodothyronine
   (T3) can be measured successfully in faecal matter of African elephants,
   Loxodonta africana. However, to our knowledge, research into factors
   affecting changes in elephant T3 levels has only been carried out in
   captive elephants so far. Thus, we present the first study of faecal T3
   metabolite (mT3) concentrations of a large population of free-ranging
   African elephants. Over 15 months, we collected faecal samples from
   identified (n = 43 samples) and unidentified (n = 145 samples)
   individuals in Madikwe Game Reserve, South Africa. We investigated
   whether vegetative productivity {[}normalized difference vegetation
   index (NDVI)] in interaction with mean monthly temperature, age and sex
   affected mT3 concentrations. We found a significant negative interaction
   effect of NDVI and temperature. Increasing NDVI was related to higher
   concentrations of mT3, but increasing temperature was related to a
   decrease in mT3 concentrations in individually identified and
   unidentified elephants. In unidentified individuals, juvenile elephants
   had significantly higher mT3 concentrations compared to adult elephants.
   Faecal T3 can successfully be quantified in samples from free-ranging
   elephant populations and thus provides insight into energy expenditure
   in large herbivores.},

Title = {Complex tourism and season interactions contribute to disparate
   physiologies in an endangered rock iguana},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},

Abstract = {To promote survival and fitness, organisms use a suite of physiological
   systems to respond to both predictable and unpredictable changes in the
   environment. These physiological responses are also influenced by
   changes in life history state. The continued activation of physiological
   systems stemming from persistent environmental perturbations enable
   animals to cope with these challenges but may over time lead to
   significant effects on the health of wildlife. In the present study, we
   tested how varying environmental perturbations driven by tourism and
   associated supplemental feeding affects the energetics, corticosterone
   and immunity of six discrete populations of the northern Bahamian rock
   iguana (Cyclura cychlura inornata and Cyclura cychlura figginsi). We
   studied populations within and outside the reproductive season and
   quantified tourist numbers during sample collection. Specifically, we
   measured clutch size, body condition, plasma energy metabolites,
   reactive oxygen species, baseline corticosterone concentrations and
   immune function of male and female iguanas from each population to
   address whether (i) disparate physiologies are emerging across a
   gradient of tourism and feeding, (ii) both subspecies respond similarly
   and (iii) responses vary with season/reproductive condition. We found
   significant effects of tourism level, season and their interaction on
   the physiology of both C. c. inornata and C. c. figginsi, supporting the
   idea that tourism is leading to the divergence of phenotypes.
   Specifically, we found elevated plasma energy metabolites, oxidative
   stress and a measure of innate immunity (bactericidal ability), but
   reduced corticosterone concentrations with increasing tourism in both
   subspecies of rock iguanas. These physiological metrics differ according
   to the level of tourism in both subspecies and persist across seasons
   despite variation with natural seasonal and reproductive changes. These
   findings suggest that anthropogenic disturbance results in disparate
   physiologies in northern Bahamian rock iguanas.},

Title = {Are the effects of catch-and-release angling evident in changes to mRNA

Abstract = {Catch-and-release (C\&R) angling is a conservation-oriented practice
   intended to reduce the impact recreational angling has on fish
   populations. Even though most recreationally angled fish are released,
   little is known about how C\&R angling impacts fish at the cellular or
   tissue level. As the first to explore the impacts of C\&R angling on
   mRNA abundances, our study aimed to identify how the stress of angling
   influenced metabolism, acid-base regulation and cellular stress in the
   gills of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Because gills are
   responsible for metabolic gas exchange, are crucial sites of acid-base
   homeostasis and respond to stressors quickly, we hypothesized that the
   relative mRNA abundance of genes related to these three physiological
   processes would be altered after angling. We took gill samples of live
   lake trout at 0, 2 or 48 h after fish were angled by rod and reel, and
   then used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure the relative abundance of
   nine candidate mRNA transcripts. Heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) mRNA
   levels significantly increased over 5-fold 2 h after angling, indicating
   a potential activation of a cytoprotective response. However, contrary
   to our hypothesis, we observed no change in the relative mRNA abundance
   of genes related to metabolism or acid-base regulation in response to
   C\&R angling within a 48-h period. As C\&R angling can negatively impact
   fish populations, further use of transcript-level studies will allow us
   to understand the impact C\&R has on specific tissues and improve our
   knowledge of how C\&R influences overall fish health.},

Abstract = {Intraspecific trait variation has large effects on the ecosystem and is
   greatly affected by human activities. To date, most studies focused on
   single-trait analyses, while considering multiple traits is expected to
   better predict how an individual interacts with its environment. Here,
   we used a mesocosm experiment with fish Oryzias latipes to test whether
   individual growth, boldness and functional traits (feeding rate and
   stoichiometric traits) formed one functional pace-of-life syndrome
   (POLS). We then tested the effects of among-individual mean and variance
   of fish functional POLSs within mesocosms on invertebrate community
   (e.g. zoobenthos and zooplankton abundances) and ecosystem processes
   (e.g. ecosystem metabolism, algae stock, nutrient concentrations).
   Stoichiometric traits correlated with somatic growth and behaviours,
   forming two independent functional POLS (i.e. two major covariance
   axes). Mean values of the first syndrome were sex- and
   environment-dependent and were associated with (i) long-term (10
   generations; 4 years) selection for small or large body size resulting
   in contrasting life histories and (ii) short-term (6 weeks) effects of
   experimental treatments on resource availability (through manipulation
   of light intensity and interspecific competition). Specifically, females
   and individuals from populations selected for a small body size
   presented fast functional POLS with faster growth rate, higher carbon
   body content and lower boldness. Individuals exposed to low resources
   (low light and high competition) displayed a slow functional POLS.
   Higher mesocosm mean and variance values in the second functional POLS
   (i.e. high feeding rate, high carbon:nitrogen body ratio, low ammonium
   excretion rate) were associated to decreased prey abundances, but did
   not affect any of the ecosystem processes. We highlighted the presence
   of functional multi-trait covariation in medaka, which were affected by
   sex, long-term selection history and short-term environmental
   conditions, that ultimately had cascading ecological consequences. We
   stressed the need for applying this approach to better predict ecosystem
   response to anthropogenic global changes.},

   swimming performance of contrasting freshwater fish},

Abstract = {Artificial barriers cause widespread impacts on freshwater fish.
   Swimming performance is often used as the key metric in assessing
   fishes' responses to river barriers. However, barrier mitigation is
   generally based on the swimming ability of salmonids and other strong
   swimmers because knowledge of swimming ability for most other freshwater
   fish is poor. Also, fish pass designs tend to adopt a `one size fits
   all' approach because little is known about population or individual
   variability in swimming performance. Here, we assessed interspecific and
   intraspecific differences in the sustained swimming speed (U-sus) of
   five freshwater fish with contrasting body sizes, morphologies and
   swimming modes: topmouth gudgeon, European minnow, stone loach, bullhead
   and brown trout. Significant U-sus variation was identified at three
   organizational levels: species, populations and individual.
   Interspecific differences in U-sus were as large as 64 cm s(-1),
   upstream populations of brown trout showed mean U-sus 27 cm s(-1) higher
   than downstream populations, and species exhibited high individual
   variation (e.g. cv = 62\% in European minnow). Sustained swimming speed
   (U-sus) increased significantly with body size in topmouth gudgeon,
   European minnow and brown trout, but not in the two benthic species,
   bullhead and stone loach. Aerobic scope had a significant positive
   effect on U-sus in European minnow, stone loach and brown trout.
   Sustained swimming speed (U-sus) decreased with relative pectoral fin
   length in European minnow and brown trout, whereas body fineness was the
   best predictor in stone loach and bullhead. Hence, swimming performance
   correlated with a diverse range of traits that are rarely considered
   when predicting fish passage. Our study highlights the dangers of using
   species' average swimming speeds and illustrates why a `one size fits
   all' approach often fails to mitigate for barrier effects. We call for
   an evidence-based approach to barrier mitigation, one that recognizes
   natural variability at multiple hierarchical levels.},

Abstract = {Early marine survival of juvenile salmon is intimately associated with
   their physiological condition during smoltification and ocean entry.
   Smoltification (parr-smolt transformation) is a developmental process
   that allows salmon to acquire seawater tolerance in preparation for
   marine living. Traditionally, this developmental process has been
   monitored using gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity or plasma hormones,
   but gill gene expression offers the possibility of another method. Here,
   we describe the discovery of candidate genes from gill tissue for
   staging smoltification using comparisons of microarray studies with
   particular focus on the commonalities between anadromous Rainbow trout
   and Sockeye salmon datasets, as well as a literature comparison
   encompassing more species. A subset of 37 candidate genes mainly from
   the microarray analyses was used for TaqMan quantitative PCR assay
   design and their expression patterns were validated using gill samples
   from four groups, representing three species and two ecotypes: Coho
   salmon, Sockeye salmon, stream-type Chinook salmon and ocean-type
   Chinook salmon. The best smoltification biomarkers, as measured by
   consistent changes across these four groups, were genes involved in ion
   regulation, oxygen transport and immunity. Smoltification gene
   expression patterns (using the top 10 biomarkers) were confirmedby
   significant correlations with NKA activity and were associated with
   changes in body brightness, caudal fin darkness and caudal peduncle
   length. We incorporate gene expression patterns of pre-smolt, smolt and
   de-smolt trials from acute seawater transfers from a companion study to
   develop a preliminary seawater tolerance classification model for
   ocean-type Chinook salmon. This work demonstrates the potential of gene
   expression biomarkers to stage smoltification and classify juveniles as
   pre-smolt, smolt or de-smolt.},

Title = {Reference intervals for blood-based biochemical analytes of southern
   Beaufort Sea polar bears},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Accurate reference intervals (RIs) for commonly measured blood-based
   analytes are essential for health monitoring programmes. Baseline values
   for a panel of analytes can be used to monitor physiologic and
   pathophysiologic processes such as organ function, electrolyte balance
   and protein catabolism. Our reference population includes 651 serum
   samples from polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from the southern Beaufort
   Sea (SB) subpopulation sampled in Alaska, USA, between 1983 and 2016. To
   establish RI for 13 biochemical analytes, we defined specific criteria
   for characterizing the reference population and relevant subgroups. To
   account for differences in seasonal life history characteristics, we
   determined separate RI for the spring and fall seasons, when prey
   availability and energetic requirements of bears differ. We established
   RI for five subgroups in spring based on sex, age class and denning
   status, and three subgroups in fall based on sex and age class in
   females only. Alkaline phosphatase activities were twice as high in
   subadult as in adult polar bears in spring (z(males) = 4.08, P-males <
   0.001, z(females) = 3.90, P-females < 0.001) and did not differ between
   seasons. Denning females had significantly higher glucose concentrations
   than non-denning females (z = 4.94, P < 0.001), possibly reflecting
   differences in energy expenditure during lactation. A total of 10 of the
   13 analytes differed significantly between seasons in either males or
   females; however, the physiologic importance of these differences may be
   minimal. Establishing these RIs allows for temporal monitoring of polar
   bear health in the SB and may prove useful for assessing and monitoring
   additional polar bear subpopulations in a changing Arctic environment.},

Title = {Suppression of LOX activity enhanced seed vigour and longevity of
   tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> L.) seeds during storage},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},

Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {The preservation of seed viability and quality in storage is an
   important trait both for commercial and germplasm usage. To better
   explore potential mechanisms of tobacco seed deterioration, seed packed
   in cloth bag (C) and vacuum bag (V) were stored under room temperature
   (RT) and low temperature (LT, 18 degrees C), and sampled periodically
   for laboratory testing. Seed stored in low temperature with vacuum bag
   (LT/V) owned the highest seed vigour after 25 months of storage and in
   room temperature with cloth bag (RT/C) lost seed vigour and germination
   ability after 20-month storage. Meanwhile, seed in RT/C notably
   increased about 5-fold endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 4-fold
   malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, 12-fold Lipoxygenases (LOX) activity and
   2-fold the expression of NtLOX3 comparing with LT/V at the end of
   15-month storage. In addition, regression analysis indicated that LOX
   activity was strongly negatively correlated with seed vigour as the R-2
   value reached 0.970 in RT/C. Furthermore, caffeic acid and catechin, the
   inhibitors of LOX activity, were applied to tobacco seeds pre-treatment
   and followed with artificial accelerated aging. Seeds pretreated with
   inhibitors, especially caffeic acid, reduced LOX activity by 50\%, MDA
   and H2O2 contents by 40\% and 20\%, respectively, and increased more
   than 1.2-fold seed vigour and seedling quality comparing with seeds
   pretreated with H2O after 6-day artificial aging, indicating a better
   seed storability after artificial accelerated aging. These results
   suggest that LOX accelerated seed aging, and suppression of LOX activity
   enhanced seed vigour and viability in accelerated aging tobacco seed,
   opening new opportunities for effective management of seed germplasm
   under long-term storage and conservation.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances are a major concern for the welfare and
   conservation of wildlife. We recorded heart rate and body temperature of
   20 free-living greylag geese in response to a major regularly
   re-occurring anthropogenic disturbance-New Year's Eve fireworks. Heart
   rate and body temperature were significantly higher in the first and
   second hour of the new year, compared with the same hour on the 31st of
   December, the average during December and the average during January.
   Heart rate and body temperature was not significantly affected by sex or
   age. From 0200 to 0300 onwards, 1st of January heart rates did not
   significantly differ from the other periods; however, body temperatures
   were significantly increased until 0300-0400. From 0400 to 0500, heart
   rate was not affected by any of the investigated factors, whereas body
   temperature was significantly increased on the 1st of January compared
   with the 31st of December and the December average but not compared with
   the January average. To conclude, our results show that New Year's Eve
   fireworks cause a substantial physiological response, indicative of a
   stress response in greylag geese, which is costly in terms of energy
   expenditure.},

Title = {DEB-IBM for predicting climate change and anthropogenic impacts on
   population dynamics of hairtail Trichiurus lepturus in the East China
   Sea},

Abstract = {The hairtail Trichiurus lepturus supports the largest fisheries in the
   East China Sea. The stock has fluctuated in the past few decades and
   this variation has been attributed to human pressures and climate
   change. To investigate energetics of individuals and population dynamics
   of the species in responses to environmental variations and fishing
   efforts, we have developed a DEB-IBM by coupling a dynamic energy budget
   (DEB) model to an individual-based model (IBM). The parameter estimation
   of DEB model shows an acceptable goodness of fit. The DEB-IBM was
   validated with histological data for a period of 38 years. High fishing
   pressure was largely responsible for the dramatic decline of the stock
   in middle 1980s. The stock recovered from early 1990s, which coincided
   with introduction of fishing moratorium on spawning stocks in inshore
   waters and substantial decrease of fishing efforts from large fisheries
   companies. In addition, the population average age showed a trend of
   slight decrease. The model successfully reproduced these observations of
   interannual variations in the population dynamics. The model was then
   implemented to simulate the effect of climate change on the population
   performance under greenhouse gas emission scenarios projected for 2100.
   It was also used to explore population responses to changing fishing
   mortalities. These scenario simulations have shown that the population
   biomass under SSP1-1.9, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 would decline by 7.5\%,
   16.6\% and 30.1\%, respectively, in 2100. The model predicts that
   increasing fishing mortality by 10\% will cause 5.3\% decline of the
   population biomass, whereas decrease of fishing mortality by 10\% will
   result in 6.8\% increase of the biomass. The development of the DEB-IBM
   provides a predictive tool to inform management decisions for
   sustainable exploitation of the hairtail stock in the East China Sea.},

Title = {Under cover of the night: context-dependency of anthropogenic

Abstract = {We tested whether proximity to sources of anthropogenic disturbance
   influenced baseline stress levels of a wild ungulate in relation to
   their space use behaviour. We found that faecal cortisol metabolites
   increased as distance to human infrastructure decreased, but this
   relationship was buffered by the use of refuge habitats during daytime.
   Wildlife populations are increasingly exposed to human-induced
   modifications of their habitats. To cope with anthropogenic stressors,
   animals can adjust their behaviour-for example, by shifting their
   activity to more sheltered habitats, or becoming more nocturnal.
   However, whether use of spatial and temporal adjustments in behaviour
   may regulate the endocrine response is poorly documented. Here, we
   analyzed faecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) of wild roe deer (Capreolus
   capreolus) living in a human-dominated agro-ecosystem. Using Global
   Positioning System monitoring of 116 individuals, we assessed their
   spatial behaviour and tested whether proximity to anthropogenic
   structures (linear distance to built-up areas) and the use of refuge
   habitats (woodland and hedges) influenced FCM levels. In accordance with
   our predictions, individuals ranging closer to anthropogenic structures
   during daytime had higher FCM levels, but this relationship was buffered
   as use of refuge habitat increased. In addition, this link between
   proximity to anthropogenic structures and FCM levels disappeared when we
   analyzed spatial behaviour at night. Finally, FCM levels were higher
   when the ambient temperature was lower, and during years of low resource
   availability. Our results demonstrate that the stress levels of large
   mammals may be strongly influenced by their proximity to anthropogenic
   activities, but that these effects may be buffered by behavioural
   adjustments in terms of space use and circadian rhythm. Whereas most
   studies have focused on the influence of environmental heterogeneity,
   our analysis highlights the need to also consider the fine-scale spatial
   response of individuals when studying the hormonal response of wild
   animals to human disturbance. We emphasize the potential to mitigate
   this hormonal stress response, and its potential negative consequences
   on population dynamics, through the preservation or restoration of
   patches of refuge habitat in close proximity to human infrastructure.},

Abstract = {Many insects sequester nutrients during developmentally programmed
   periods, which they metabolize during subsequent life history stages.
   During these periods, failure to store adequate nutrients can have
   persistent effects on fitness. Here, we examined a critical but
   under-studied nutrient storage period in queen bumble bees: the first
   days of adult life, which are followed by a diapause period typically
   coinciding with winter. We experimentally manipulated availability of
   pollen (the primary dietary source of lipids and protein) and the sugar
   concentration of artificial nectar (the primary source of carbohydrates)
   for laboratory-reared queens during this period and examined three
   nutritional phenomena: (i) diet impacts on nutritional status, (ii) the
   timescale upon which nutrient sequestration occurs and (iii) the fitness
   consequences of nutrient sequestration, specifically related to survival
   across the life cycle. We found evidence that pollen and nectar
   starvation negatively impact lipid storage, whereas nectar sugar
   concentration impacts stored carbohydrates. The majority of nutrients
   were stored during the first similar to 3 days of adult life. Nutrients
   derived from pollen during this period appear to be more critical for
   surviving earlier life stages, whereas nutrients sequestered from nectar
   become more important for surviving the diapause and post-diapause
   periods. Negative impacts of a poor diet during early life persisted in
   our experiment, even when pollen and a relatively high (50\%) nectar
   sugar concentration were provided post-diapause. Based on these
   findings, we posit that the nutritional environment during the early
   adult life of queens has both immediate and persistent impacts on
   fitness. These findings underscore the importance of examining effects
   of stage-specific nutritional limitations on physiology and life history
   traits in this social insect group. Moreover, the findings may shed
   light on how declining food resources are contributing to the decline of
   wild bumble bee populations.},

Title = {The influence of tourist visitation on the heterophyl to lymphocyte

Abstract = {Stress levels measured by heterophile to lymphocyte ratios of adult and
   chick Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus from Martillo Island
   were higher in areas exposed versus not exposed to tourism, except for
   2020. Stress levels were also lower with lower trophic values for all
   individuals.
   Wildlife tourism is increasing worldwide and monitoring the impact of
   tourism on wild populations is of the utmost importance for species
   conservation. The Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus colony at
   Martillo Island, Argentina, was studied in the 2016-2020 breeding
   seasons. In all seasons, adults and chicks belonged to: (i) an area
   close to or within the tourist trail or (ii) an area far from the
   tourist trail and out of sight of the tourists. Blood samples were taken
   for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition, in order to estimate
   trophic niches, and for smears that were made in situ and were then
   stained in the laboratory where leucocyte counts and differentiation
   were made under optical microscope. Heterophil to lymphocyte ratios were
   used as proxies of stress. Repeated sampling showed individual stress
   levels reduced while wintering. In 2017, stress levels and trophic
   values were lower than 2018 for the same individuals. Trophic levels did
   not differ between tourism and no tourism areas within each season, and
   differed between 2017 and the remaining seasons, indicating a possible
   diet shift that year. Stress levels were higher for the tourism area
   than the no tourism area for adults and chicks in all years except for
   2020, when stress levels in the tourism area were lower and similar to
   the no tourism area that year and previous years. Vessel transit within
   the Beagle Channel and tourist visitation to the penguin colony was
   greatly reduced in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A combination of
   internal characteristics and external factors may be affecting the
   stress physiology of individuals. Therefore, future research should
   include sampling of multiple aspects of penguin physiology, behaviour
   and environmental context in order to evaluate each effect on Magellanic
   penguin stress and, ultimately, inform the conservation of this iconic
   species in time.},

Abstract = {A consequence of the poaching crisis is that managed rhinoceros
   populations are increasingly important for species conservation.
   However, black rhinoceroses (BR; Diceros bicornis) and Sumatran
   rhinoceroses (SR; Dicerorhinus Sumatrensis) in human care often store
   excessive iron in organ tissues, a condition termed iron overload
   disorder (IOD). IOD research is impeded by the challenge of accurately
   monitoring body iron load in living rhinoceroses. The goals of this
   study were to (i) determine if labile plasma iron (LPI) is an accurate
   IOD biomarker and (ii) identify factors associated with iron-independent
   serum oxidative reduction potential (ORP). Serum (106 samples) from SRs
   (n = 8), BRs (n = 28), white rhinoceros (n = 24) and greater one-horned
   rhinoceros (GOH; n = 16) was analysed for LPI. Samples from all four
   species tested positive for LPI, and a higher proportion of GOH
   rhinoceros samples were LPI positive compared with those of the other
   three species (P < 0.05). In SRs, the only LPI-positive samples were
   those from individuals clinically ill with IOD, but samples from
   outwardly healthy individuals of the other three species were LPI
   positive. Serum ORP was lower in SRs compared with that in the other
   three species (P < 0.001), and iron chelation only reduced ORP in the
   GOH species (P < 0.01; similar to 5\%). Serum ORP sex bias was revealed
   in three species with males exhibiting higher ORP than females (P <
   0.001), the exception being the SR in which ORP was low for both sexes.
   ORP was not associated with age or serum iron concentrations (P >=
   0.05), but was positively correlated with ferritin (P < 0.01). The
   disconnect between LPI and IOD was unanticipated, and LPI cannot be
   recommended as a biomarker of advanced rhino IOD. However, data provide
   valuable insight into the complex puzzle of rhinoceros IOD.},

Title = {Does a cannibal feeding strategy impart differential metabolic
   performance in young burbot (<i>Lota lota maculosa</i>)?},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {The practice of mitigating cannibalism in aquaculture is an important
   focus for hatcheries seeking to maximize yield and has been maintained
   in hatcheries focusing on wild stock restoration. We hypothesize,
   however, that a cannibal feeding strategy may confer performance
   advantages over a non-cannibal feeding strategy and that perhaps
   cannibal size grading may not be optimal for hatcheries focusing on
   conservation goals. This study examined metabolic performance
   differences between cannibal and non-cannibal burbot, Lota lota
   maculosa, at the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho Twin Rivers Hatchery in Moyie
   Springs, ID, USA. After habitat alteration led to functional extinction
   of burbot in the region, the Twin Rivers Hatchery has played a leading
   role in the reestablishment of burbot in the Kootenai River, ID, and
   British Columbia. We examined morphometric data (weight, length and
   condition factor), whole animal resting metabolic rate and the enzyme
   activity of lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and
   3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase to describe the baseline metabolic
   performance of cannibal and non-cannibal burbot. Taken together, our
   results demonstrated significant differences in the metabolic strategies
   of cannibal vs. non-cannibal burbot, where cannibals relied more heavily
   on carbohydrate metabolism and non-cannibals relied more heavily on
   glycolytic and lipid metabolism. This study demonstrates the need to
   reevaluate the traditional practice of removing cannibal fish in
   conservation hatcheries, as it may not be the ideal strategy of raising
   the most robust individuals for release. When natural habitat conditions
   cannot be restored due to permanent habitat alteration, prioritizing
   release of higher performing individuals could help achieve conservation
   goals.},

Title = {Blood analytes of oceanic-juvenile loggerhead sea turtles
   (<i>Caretta</i> <i>caretta</i>) from Azorean waters: reference
   intervals, size-relevant correlations and comparisons to neritic

Abstract = {Blood analyte reference intervals are scarce for immature life stages of
   the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta). The objectives of this
   study were to (1) document reference intervals of packed cell volume
   (PCV) and 20 plasma chemistry analytes from wild oceanic-juvenile stage
   loggerhead turtles from Azorean waters, (2) investigate correlations
   with body size (minimum straight carapace length: SCLmin) and (3)
   compare plasma chemistry data to those from older, larger neritic
   juveniles (<80 cm SCLmin) and adult loggerheads (>= 80 cm SCLmin) that
   have recruited to the West Atlantic in waters around Cape Canaveral,
   Florida. Twenty-eight Azorean loggerhead turtles with SCLmin of
   17.6-60.0 cm (mean 34.9 +/- 12.1 cm) were captured, sampled and
   immediately released. Reference intervals are reported. There were
   several biologically relevant correlations of blood analytes with
   SCLmin: positive correlations of PCV, proteins and triglycerides with
   SCLmin indicated somatic growth, increasing diving activity and/or diet;
   negative correlations of tissue enzymes with SCLmin suggested faster
   growth at smaller turtle size, while negative correlations of
   electrolytes with SCLmin indicated differences in diet, environmental
   conditions and/or osmoregulation unique to the geographic location.
   Comparisons of loggerhead turtles from the Azores (i.e. oceanic) and
   Cape Canaveral (i.e. neritic) identified significant differences
   regarding diet, somatic growth, and/or environment: in Azorean turtles,
   albumin, triglycerides and bilirubin increased with SCLmin, while
   alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and sodium decreased. In
   larger neritic Cape Canaveral turtles, aspartate aminotransferase
   increased with SCLmin, while the albumin: globulin ratio, phosphorus and
   cholesterol decreased. These differences suggest unique physiological
   disparities between life stage development and migration, reflecting
   biological and habitat differences between the two populations. This
   information presents biologically important data that is applicable to
   stranded individual turtles and to the population level, a tool for the
   development of conservation strategies, and a baseline for future
   temporal and spatial investigations of the Azorean loggerhead sea turtle
   population.},

Title = {Conservation physiology across scales: insights from the marine realm},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {As the field of conservation physiology develops and becomes
   increasingly integrated with ecology and conservation science, the
   fundamental concept of scale is being recognized as important,
   particularly for ensuring that physiological knowledge is contextualized
   in a manner most relevant to policy makers, conservation practitioners
   and stakeholders. Failure to consider the importance of scale in
   conservation physiology-both the challenges and the opportunities that
   it creates-will impede the ability of this discipline to generate the
   scientific understanding needed to contribute to meaningful conservation
   outcomes. Here, we have focused on five aspects of scale: biological,
   spatial, temporal, allometric and phylogenetic. We also considered the
   scale of policy and policy application relevant to those five types of
   scale as well as the merits of upscaling and downscaling to explore and
   address conservation problems. Although relevant to all systems (e.g.
   freshwater, terrestrial) we have used examples from the marine realm,
   with a particular emphasis on fishes, given the fact that there is
   existing discourse regarding scale and its relevance for marine
   conservation and management. Our synthesis revealed that all five
   aspects of scale are relevant to conservation physiology, with many
   aspects inherently linked. It is apparent that there are both
   opportunities and challenges afforded by working across scales but, to
   understand mechanisms underlying conservation problems, it is essential
   to consider scale of all sorts and to work across scales to the greatest
   extent possible. Moreover, given that the scales in biological processes
   will often not match policy and management scales, conservation
   physiology needs to show how it is relevant to aspects at different
   policy/management scales, change the scales at which policy/management
   intervention is applied or be prepared to be ignored.},

Abstract = {A key driver of the African savannah elephant population decline is the
   loss of habitat and associated human-elephant conflict. Elephant
   physiological responses to these pressures, however, are largely
   unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we evaluated faecal
   glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations as an indicator of
   adrenal activity and faecal thyroid metabolite (fT3) concentrations as
   an indicator of metabolic activity in relation to land use, livestock
   density, and human landscape modification, while controlling for the
   effects of seasonality and primary productivity (measured using the
   normalized difference vegetation index). Our best-fit model found that
   fGCM concentrations to be elevated during the dry season, in areas with
   higher human modification index values, and those with more agropastoral
   activities and livestock. There was also a negative relationship between
   primary productivity and fGCM concentrations. We found fT3
   concentrations to be higher during the wet season, in agropastoral
   landscapes, in locations with higher human activity, and in areas with
   no livestock. This study highlights how elephants balance nutritional
   rewards and risks in foraging decisions when using human-dominated
   landscapes, results that can serve to better interpret elephant
   behaviour at the human-wildlife interface and contribute to more
   insightful conservation strategies.},

Title = {Comparative genomics of cetartiodactyla: energy metabolism underpins the
   transition to an aquatic lifestyle},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {Foraging disruption caused by human activities is emerging as a key
   issue in cetacean conservation because it can affect nutrient levels and
   the amount of energy available to individuals to invest into
   reproduction. Our ability to predict how anthropogenic stressors affect
   these ecological processes and ultimately population trajectory depends
   crucially on our understanding of the complex physiological mechanisms
   that detect nutrient availability and regulate energy metabolism,
   foraging behavior and life-history decisions. These physiological
   mechanisms are likely to differ considerably from terrestrial mammalian
   model systems. Here, we examine nucleotide substitution rates in
   cetacean and other artiodactyl genomes to identify signatures of
   selection in genes associated with nutrient sensing pathways. We also
   estimated the likely physiological consequences of adaptive amino acid
   substitutions for pathway functions. Our results highlight that genes
   involved in the insulin, mTOR and NF-kB pathways are subject to
   significant positive selection in cetaceans compared to terrestrial
   artiodactyla. These genes may have been positively selected to enable
   cetaceans to adapt to a glucose-poor diet, to overcome deleterious
   effects caused by hypoxia during diving (e.g. oxidative stress and
   inflammation) and to modify fat-depot signaling functions in a manner
   different to terrestrial mammals. We thus show that adaptation in
   cetaceans to an aquatic lifestyle significantly affected functions in
   nutrient sensing pathways. The use of fat stores as a condition index in
   cetaceans may be confounded by the multiple and critical roles fat has
   in regulating cetacean metabolism, foraging behavior and diving
   physiology.},

Title = {Seasonal dynamics of parasitism and stress physiology in wild giant
   pandas},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 28},
Abstract = {Many factors, including the inner status of the individuals and external
   environment, can influence the parasite infections and stress physiology
   in mammals. Here, we explored the influence of the sex, age,
   reproductive season and seasonal food availability on the parasitism and
   stress physiology in wild giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) through
   nutrient and steroid hormone analysis and parasitic infection
   measurement. Diet composition had significant influences on the faecal
   cortisol levels and parasite load of wild giant pandas. The seasonal
   dynamic of the cortisol levels and parasite load in faeces co-vary with
   the seasonal nutrient intake levels of the pandas, which concurrently
   arrived the peaks at the wood bamboo shoot-eating period in May
   (parasite infection intensity, 41.47 +/- 12.11 eggs/g of wet faeces;
   cortisol levels, 619.34 +/- 70.55 ng/g dry faeces) that the nutrition
   intake by wild pandas was the highest (protein/fibre, 69.23 +/- 9.93).
   Meanwhile, age class is also as an important factor to affect the
   parasite load and stress physiology of wild giant pandas. Cubs and
   sub-adults suffered more helminth burden and stress physiology than
   adults and old individuals. This is the first study to evaluate the
   inner and external factors influence on parasitism and stress physiology
   in wild giant pandas. The findings facilitate a better understanding of
   how environmental factors might influence the physiology, behaviour and
   health of pandas and other species and have implications for the
   conservation and management of the endangered species.},

Title = {Predicting the vulnerability of birds to trophic threat posed by
   phenological mismatch based on nutritional and physiological status of
   nestlings},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {Climate change induced phenological mismatches between nestlings and
   their optimal food resources have been found to negatively influence the
   survival of many bird species. Discriminating which species is
   vulnerable to such threat is difficult only based on the diet
   observation, and therefore it is necessary to establish a more reliable
   method to predict the vulnerability of bird species. In the case of
   Asian short-toed lark (Calandrella cheleensis), we predicted such
   vulnerability by evaluating whether nestlings can absorb equal level of
   nutrients from different diets and maintain equal physiological status.
   We compared the diet, plasma nutrients, plasma insulin-like growth
   factor-1 (IGF-1), body mass and survival rate of nestlings hatched under
   different optimal food (grasshopper nymph) abundance conditions in two
   breeding seasons. Plasma glucides, amino acids, tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
   cycle metabolites, some fatty acids, IGF-1, body mass and survival rate
   of the nestlings hatched under medium or low nymph abundance conditions
   were significantly lower than those of nestlings hatched under high
   nymph abundance condition. The relative abundance of plasma amino acids,
   glucides, TCA cycle metabolites and fatty acids were significantly, and
   positively, correlated with IGF-1 levels, which, in turn, was positively
   correlated with nestling body mass. These results indicate that the diet
   with low optimal food proportion was nutritionally inferior to the diet
   with high optimal food proportion and inhibited the growth of nestlings.
   Species like Asian short-toed lark is vulnerable to the trophic threat
   induced by phenological mismatch because the alternative food is
   insufficient to satisfy the nutritional requirement of nestlings.},

Title = {Repeated adrenocorticotropic hormone administration alters adrenal and
   thyroid hormones in free-ranging elephant seals},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 17},
Abstract = {Understanding the physiological response of marine mammals to
   anthropogenic stressors can inform marine ecosystem conservation
   strategies. Stress stimulates the activation of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and synthesis of
   glucocorticoid (GC) hormones, which increase energy substrate
   availability while suppressing energy-intensive processes. Exposure to
   repeated stressors can potentially affect an animal's ability to respond
   to and recover from subsequent challenges. To mimic repeated activation
   of the HPA axis by environmental stressors (or challenges), we
   administered adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to free-ranging juvenile
   northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris; n = 7) once daily for
   4 days. ACTH administration induced significant elevation in circulating
   cortisol and aldosterone levels. The cortisol responses did not vary in
   magnitude between the first ACTH administration on Day 1 and the last
   administration on Day 4. In contrast, aldosterone levels remained
   elevated above baseline for at least 24 h after each ACTH injection, and
   responses were greater on Day 4 than Day 1. Total triiodothyronine (tT3)
   levels were decreased on Day 4 relative to Day 1, while reverse
   triiodothyronine (rT3) concentrations increased relative to baseline on
   Days 1 and 4 in response to ACTH, indicating a suppression of thyroid
   hormone production. There was no effect of ACTH on the sex steroid
   dehydroepiandrosterone. These data suggest that elephant seals are able
   to mount adrenal responses to multiple ACTH administrations. However,
   repeated ACTH administration resulted in facilitation of aldosterone
   secretion and suppression of tT3, which may impact osmoregulation and
   metabolism, respectively. We propose that aldosterone and tT3 are
   informative additional indicators of repeated stress in marine mammals.},

Abstract = {Blood biochemistry represents a minimally invasive tool for monitoring
   sea turtle health, assessing injured sea turtles and supporting
   conservation strategies. In Grenada, West Indies, plasma biochemical
   variables were examined in 33 nesting leatherback (Dermochelys
   coriacea), 49 foraging green (Chelonia mydas), 49 foraging hawksbill
   (Eretmochelys imbricata) and 12 nesting hawksbill sea turtles sampled
   between 2017 and 2022. Plasma biochemistry reference intervals are
   described herein except for nesting hawksbills, which are represented by
   descriptive statistics due to the low sample size. Select analyte
   concentrations were positively correlated with curved carapace length in
   leatherbacks (chloride), green turtles (total protein, albumin and
   globulin) and foraging hawksbills (total protein, albumin and
   phosphorus). Cholesterol (7.8 mmol/l +/- 1.6 SD) and triglyceride (6.9
   mmol/l +/- 1.9 SD) concentrations were significantly higher in
   leatherbacks compared to foraging green turtles, foraging hawksbills and
   nesting hawksbills (P < 0.001 for all). Cholesterol was significantly
   higher in nesting hawksbills compared to foraging green turtles (P =
   0.050) and foraging hawksbills (P = 0.050). Foraging hawksbills
   demonstrated significantly higher aspartate transaminase activities than
   leatherbacks (P = 0.002), green turtles (P = 0.009) and nesting
   hawksbills (P < 0.001). Biochemical results provide baseline population
   health data and support guidance for treatments during clinical sea
   turtle rehabilitation efforts. They also provide insight into
   species-specific physiologic differences and preludes further studies to
   better characterize the impacts of life-stage class on biochemistry
   reference intervals to better support wild sea turtle populations in
   Grenada.},

Title = {Quantifying changes in umbilicus size to estimate the relative age of
   neonatal blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus)},

Abstract = {Sharks can incur a range of external injuries throughout their lives
   that originate from various sources, but some of the most notable wounds
   in viviparous shark neonates are at the umbilicus. Umbilical wounds
   typically heal within 1 to 2 months post-parturition, depending on the
   species, and are therefore often used as an indicator of neonatal life
   stage or as a relative measure of age {[}e.g. grouping by umbilical
   wound classes (UWCs), according to the size of their umbilicus]. To
   improve comparisons of early-life characteristics between studies,
   species and across populations, studies using UWCs should integrate
   quantitative changes. To overcome this issue, we set out to quantify
   changes in umbilicus size of neonatal blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus
   melanopterus) around the island of Moorea, French Polynesia, based on
   temporal regression relationships of umbilicus size. Here, we provide a
   detailed description for the construction of similar quantitative
   umbilical wound classifications, and we subsequently validate the
   accuracy of our classification and discuss two examples to illustrate
   its efficacy, depletion rate of maternally provided energy reserves and
   estimation of parturition period. A significant decrease in body
   condition in neonatal sharks as early as twelve days post-parturition
   suggests a rapid depletion of in utero-allocated energy reserves stored
   in the liver. Back calculations of timing of birth based on the
   umbilicus size of neonates determine a parturition season from September
   to January, with most parturitions occurring during October and
   November. As such, this study contributes valuable data to inform the
   conservation and management of young-of-the-year blacktip reef sharks,
   and we therefore encourage the construction and use of similar
   regression relationships for other viviparous shark species.
   Live-bearing shark species are inherently born with an open wound, the
   umbilicus. The healing status of this umbilicus can be used to estimate
   the age of newborn sharks. This study proposes the first umbilical wound
   classification based on quantitative changes in umbilicus size allowing
   accurate age estimates of newborn sharks.},

Title = {Stress response to handling is short lived but may reflect personalities
   in a wild, Critically Endangered tortoise species},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {We investigated the acute stress response associated with animal
   personalities by measuring plasma glucocorticoids throughout handling
   and collected similar to 2 years of movement and behavioural data in a
   wild, Critically Endangered animal, Astrochelys radiata (radiated
   tortoise). To determine whether our standard, brief conscientious
   handling procedures induce a stress response in our target species, we
   applied a stressor by way of initial animal processing and deployment of
   telemetry equipment. During surveys and processing, we sampled animals
   immediately upon detection, again after completing transmitter
   attachment and processing, and a final time the following day. We then
   used radiotelemetry to follow a subset of the animals for 22 months
   while collecting behavioural, climatic and location data. We found that
   brief and conscientious handling did not illicit consistent changes in
   plasma concentrations of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) but
   did reveal tremendous individual variation in response. The CORT
   concentration ranged more than 200-fold after imposing the stressor and
   returned to near-baseline values by the following day. When we accounted
   for the wide variation by calculating the degree of each individual's
   stress response relative to its baseline over its processing time, we
   discovered two non-overlapping physiological response types; those in
   which CORT concentrations increased dramatically in response to handling
   (219 +/- 89.8 pg/ml/min) and those in which CORT varied only slightly
   (5.3 +/- 8.9 pg/ml/min). The response types (strong vs. mild) also
   predicted body condition, home range size, activity, and behavioural
   tendencies. The degree of the individual's stress response in this
   species may be one component of correlated physiological and behavioural
   traits (animal personalities), which have previously been obscured in
   other chelonian studies by the use of mean values and should be
   considered in future conservation management applications for chelonian
   species.},

Title = {Qiviut cortisol in muskoxen as a potential tool for informing
   conservation strategies},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) are increasingly subject to multiple new
   stressors associated with unprecedented climate change and increased
   anthropogenic activities across much of their range. Hair may provide a
   measurement of stress hormones (glucocorticoids) over periods of weeks
   to months. We developed a reliable method to quantify cortisol in the
   qiviut (wooly undercoat) of muskoxen using liquid chromatography coupled
   to tandem mass spectrometry. We then applied this technique to determine
   the natural variability in qiviut cortisol levels among 150 wild
   muskoxen, and to assess differences between sexes, seasons and years of
   collection. Qiviut samples were collected from the rump of adult
   muskoxen by subsistence and sport hunters in seven different locations
   in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories between 2013 and 2016. Results
   showed a high inter-individual variability in qiviut cortisol
   concentrations, with levels ranging from 3.5 to 48.9 pg/mg (median 11.7
   pg/mg). Qiviut cortisol levels were significantly higher in males than
   females, and varied seasonally (summer levels were significantly lower
   than in fall and winter), and by year (levels significantly increased
   from 2013 to 2015). These differences may reflect distinct environmental
   conditions and the diverse stressors experienced, as well as
   physiological and/or behavioural characteristics. Quantification of
   qiviut cortisol may serve as a valuable tool for monitoring health and
   informing conservation and management efforts.},

Title = {Assessment of season-dependent body condition scores in relation to
   faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in free-ranging Asian elephants},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {We studied seasonal and annual changes in visual body condition scores
   (BCSs), and assessed how these scores were related to levels of faecal
   glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) in free-ranging Asian elephants
   (Elephas maximus) in the seasonally dry tropical forests of the Mysore
   and Nilgiri Elephant Reserves in southern India. We assessed the
   animals' BCS visually on a scale of 1 to 5; where 1 represents a very
   thin and 5 represents a very fat elephant. To understand the influence
   of seasonality on BCS, we sampled the population during dry (n = 398)
   and wet seasons (n = 255) of 2013 and 2015 while, for annual changes in
   BCS, we sampled nine free-ranging adult females from different family
   groups that had been repeatedly sighted over seven years. To evaluate
   the influence of body condition on fGCM, 307 faecal samples were
   collected from 261 different elephants and were analysed. As a parameter
   of adrenocortical activity, and thus stress, fGCM was measured (mu g/g)
   in the ethanol-extracted samples using a group-specific
   11-oxoaetiocholanolone EIA (antibody raised against
   11-oxoaetiocholanolone-17-CMO: BSA and
   biotinylated-11-oxoaetiocholanolone as a label). Effect of age and
   season on BCS in relation to fGCM was also studied. A seasonal shift in
   BCS was observed as expected, i.e. individuals with low BCS were more
   frequent during the dry season when compared with the wet season.
   Concentrations of fGCM were highest in individuals with lowest BCS (BCS
   1) and then significantly declined till BCS 3. fGCM levels were almost
   comparable for BCS 3, 4 and 5. This pattern was more conspicuous in
   female than in male elephants. Season-dependent BCS, hence, reflect the
   stress status as measured by fGCM, especially in female Asian elephants.
   This could be used as an important non-invasive approach to monitor the
   physiological health of free-ranging elephant populations.},

Abstract = {Urbanization is a major driver of ecological change and comes with a
   suite of habitat modifications, including alterations to the local
   temperature, precipitation, light and noise regimes. Although many
   recent studies have investigated the behavioural and ecological
   ramifications of urbanization, physiological work in this area has
   lagged. We tested the hypothesis that anthropogenic noise is a stressor
   for amphibians and that chronic exposure to such noise leads to
   reproductive suppression. In the laboratory, we exposed male White's
   treefrogs, Litoria caerulea, to conspecific chorus noise either alone or
   coupled with prerecorded traffic noise nightly for 1 week. Frogs
   presented with anthropogenic noise had significantly higher circulating
   concentrations of corticosterone and significantly decreased sperm count
   and sperm viability than did control frogs. These results suggest that
   in addition to having behavioural and ecological effects, anthropogenic
   change might alter physiology and Darwinian fitness. Future work should
   integrate disparate fields such as behaviour, ecology and physiology to
   elucidate fully organisms' responses to habitat change.},

Title = {Using dermal glucocorticoids to determine the effects of disease and
   environment on the critically endangered Wyoming toad},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Amphibian populations are declining worldwide, and increased exposure to
   environmental stressors, including global climate change and pathogens
   like Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), may be contributing to this
   decline. Our goal was to use a novel dermal swabbing method to measure
   glucocorticoid (GC) hormones and investigate the relationship among
   disease and environmental conditions in the critically endangered
   Wyoming toad (Anaxyrus baxteri). Our objectives were to (i) validate the
   use of dermal swabs to measure GCs using an adrenocorticotropic hormone
   (ACTH) challenge on eight captive toads (4 ACTH: 2 M, 2F and 4 saline as
   a control: 2 M, 2F), (ii) investigate stress physiology and disease
   status of 41. toads across six reintroduction sites and (iii) compare
   dermal cortisol between reintroduced and captive toads. Dermal cortisol
   peaked immediately after the ACTH and saline injections. Faecal GC
   metabolites (FGMs) were significantly higher one week after the ACTH
   injection compared with the week before. Saline-injected toads had no
   change in FGM over time. Toads were only found in three reintroduction
   sites and dermal cortisol was similar across sites; however,
   reintroduced toads had higher dermal cortisol in August compared with
   June and compared with captive individuals. Bd status did not influence
   dermal cortisol concentrations. Dermal and faecal hormonal metabolite
   analyses can be used to study amphibian stress physiology and learn how
   environmental conditions are impacting population success.},

Abstract = {Understanding stress physiology is crucial for species management
   because high levels of stress can reduce reproduction and the
   individual's ability to face threats to survive. One of the most popular
   methods for non-invasive monitoring of animal endocrine status is the
   glucocorticoid (GC) metabolite measurements, which can provide important
   information about how animals are affected by their surrounding
   environment. Here, we carried out the biological validation of
   corticosterone enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), which together with a
   cortisol EIA was used to quantified the concentrations of urofaecal GC
   metabolites (uGCMs) in wild and captive Blue-fronted amazon parrots
   (Amazona aestiva). Urofaecal GC concentrations were significantly higher
   (P< 0.05) in free-living parrots (157.9 +/- 18.5 ng cortisol/g and 61.14
   +/- 23.5 ng corticosterone/g dry urofaecal sample) than in those kept in
   captivity, which showed the comparable levels of GC metabolites
   independently of the management system applied. The higher uGCM levels
   obtained in the wild population point to an adaptive response for
   survival and species propagation in a more challenging environment, in
   comparison with captive animals. Furthermore, the lower uGCM
   concentrations in captive parrots may indicate an adaptive capacity of
   the species A. aestiva to captivity and its potential as a legal pet.
   The corticosterone EIA applied in this study proved to be an effective
   technique for the adrenocortical activity monitoring in this species. We
   discuss our findings considering the management and destiny given to
   wild-caught birds that are kept in confinement or returned to nature.},

Abstract = {Of the five species of black cockatoo in the genus Calyptorhynchus,
   those species with red tail bands (Red-tailed Black Cockatoo and Glossy
   Black Cockatoo) lay clutches of only one egg and those with white or
   yellow tail bands (Carnaby's Cockatoo, Baudin's Cockatoo and
   Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo) usually lay clutches of two. The breeding
   of the endangered Carnaby's Cockatoo has been studied from 1969 to 2012
   at a number of localities throughout its range in south-western
   Australia within a region largely cleared for agriculture. When raising
   nestlings the species feeds on seeds of native vegetation, and there was
   a strong but not significant negative relationship between nesting
   success and percentage loss of native vegetation within 6 and 12 km of
   nest hollows. There was a significant negative relationship between the
   health of nestlings and percentage loss of native vegetation around nest
   hollows. While the usual clutch size is two, average clutch size tended
   to be lower in areas where much native vegetation has been cleared.
   While both eggs hatch in 77\% of two-egg clutches, the species normally
   fledges only one young. However, the species is capable of fledging both
   nestlings from a breeding attempt. Sets of siblings are usually the
   product of older, more experienced females nesting in areas where more
   native vegetation has been retained. The conservation implications of
   these findings are discussed in the light of predicted changes to the
   climate of south-western Australia.},

Title = {Demographic and physiological signals of reproductive events in humpback
   whales on a southwest pacific breeding ground},

Abstract = {Assessing the reproductive physiology via skin-blubber biopsy samples of
   recovering populations of marine mammals is critical for conservation
   and management. We used an extensive blubber archive and associated
   demographic data to assess the seasonal changes in three reproductive
   hormones for humpback whales on a southwest Pacific breeding ground.
   The field of marine mammal conservation has dramatically benefited from
   the rapid advancement of methods to assess the reproductive physiology
   of individuals and populations from steroid hormones isolated from
   minimally invasive skin-blubber biopsy samples. Historically, this vital
   information was only available from complete anatomical and
   physiological investigations of samples collected during commercial or
   indigenous whaling. Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are a
   migratory, cosmopolitan species that reproduce in warm, low-latitude
   breeding grounds. New Caledonia is seasonally visited by a small
   breeding sub-stock of humpback whales, forming part of the endangered
   Oceania subpopulation. To better understand the demographic and seasonal
   patterns of reproductive physiology in humpback whales, we quantified
   baseline measurements of reproductive hormones (progesterone-P4,
   testosterone-T and 17 beta-estradiol-E2) using an extensive archive of
   skin-blubber biopsy samples collected from female humpback whales in New
   Caledonia waters between 2016 and 2019 (n = 194). We observed
   significant differences in the P4, T and E2 concentrations across
   different demographic groups of female humpback whales, and we described
   some of the first evidence of the endocrine patterns of estrous in live
   free-ranging baleen whales. This study is fundamental in its
   methodological approach to a wild species that has a global
   distribution, with seasonally distinct life histories. This information
   will assist in monitoring, managing and conserving this population as
   global ecological changes continue to occur unhindered.},

Title = {Socioecological and environmental predictors of physiological stress
   markers in a threatened feline species},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {In recent years, ecological studies have shown that oxidative status can
   have a significant impact on fitness components in freeranging animals.
   This has raised awareness by conservation practitioners about the
   importance of identifying the factors associated with individual
   variation in markers of oxidative status because this might provide
   several potential benefits for conservation programmes. In this study,
   we measured five markers of oxidative status in the cheetah (Acinonyx
   jubatus), a carnivore species classified as vulnerable by the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature. We asked whether the
   five measures of oxidative damage and antioxidant blood-based markers
   are associated with a number of socioecological and environmental
   factors, including individual sex, age class, living condition
   (free-ranging vs. captive), restraint duration stress (i.e. capture
   duration stress), spatial tactic of males (territory holders vs.
   non-territory holders, i.e. floaters) and reproductive status of females
   (accompanied by offspring vs. solitary). Markers of oxidative damage
   were higher in those cheetahs that were physically restraint for a
   longer duration in the trap, indicating that oxidative stress may be
   increased by short-term unpredictable environmental stressors. Markers
   of oxidative damage were also higher in captive than free-ranging
   cheetahs, suggesting that oxidative stress might be a physiological
   mechanism underlying the detrimental effects of captivity on the health
   status of cheetahs. Variation of oxidative status markers was also
   significantly associated with individual age class, spatial tactic and
   reproductive status, opening new research avenues about the role of
   oxidative stress in influencing behavioural and life-history traits in
   cheetahs.},

Title = {Ovarian cycle activity varies with respect to age and social status in
   free-ranging elephants in Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Free-ranging African elephants live in a fission-fusion society, at the
   centre of which is the matriarch. Matriarchs are generally older females
   that guide their families to resources and co-ordinate group defense.
   While much is known about elephant society, knowledge is generally
   lacking about how age affects the physiology of wild elephants.
   Investigation of the ovarian activity of free-ranging elephants could
   provide insight into the reproductive ageing process, with implications
   for population management. Faecal samples were collected from 46
   individuals ranging in age from 14 to 60 years for a 2-year period, and
   progestagen metabolite analyses were used to examine relationships
   between social status, age, season, and ovarian activity in female
   elephants in Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa. Social status
   was the strongest predictor of faecal progestagen metabolite
   concentrations in non-pregnant elephants, with grand matriarchs (n = 6)
   having the lowest values compared with matriarchs (n = 21) and
   non-matriarch females (n = 19). Likewise, social status and age were the
   strongest predictors of faecal progestagen metabolite concentrations in
   pregnant elephants (n = 27). The number of years since a nonpregnant
   female gave birth to her last calf (post-partum duration) was longer for
   older females with a higher social status, as well as during the dry
   season. Our results indicate that social standing and age of elephants
   are related to reproductive function, and that older females exhibit
   reductions in ovarian capacity. These results expand our understanding
   of reproduction and fertility throughout an elephant's lifespan, and the
   factors that impact gonadal function in free-ranging females. Given that
   possible over-abundance of elephants in areas such as Addo Elephant
   National Park is fuelling the debate over how best to manage these
   populations, knowledge about the reproductive potential of high-ranking
   females can provide managers with biological data to identify the best
   candidates for controlling growth through translocation or
   contraception.},

Abstract = {Increasing risk of pathogen spillover coupled with overall declines in
   wildlife population abundance in the Anthropocene make infectious
   disease a relevant concern for species conservation worldwide. While
   emerging molecular tools could improve our diagnostic capabilities and
   give insight into mechanisms underlying wildlife disease risk, they have
   rarely been applied in practice. Here, employing a previously reported
   gene transcription panel of common immune markers to track physiological
   changes, we present a detailed analysis over the course of both acute
   and chronic infection in one wildlife species where disease plays a
   critical role in conservation, bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis).
   Differential gene transcription patterns distinguished between infection
   statuses over the course of acute infection and differential correlation
   (DC) analyses identified clear changes in gene co-transcription patterns
   over the early stages of infection, with transcription of four
   genes-TGFb, AHR, IL1b and MX1-continuing to increase even as
   transcription of other immune-associated genes waned. In a separate
   analysis, we considered the capacity of the same gene transcription
   panel to aid in differentiating between chronically infected animals and
   animals in other disease states outside of acute disease events (an
   immediate priority for wildlife management in this system). We found
   that this transcription panel was capable of accurately identifying
   chronically infected animals in the test dataset, though additional data
   will be required to determine how far this ability extends. Taken
   together, our results showcase the successful proof of concept and
   breadth of potential utilities that gene transcription might provide to
   wildlife disease management, from direct insight into mechanisms
   associated with differential disease response to improved diagnostic
   capacity in the field.},

Title = {Seasonal changes of faecal cortisol metabolite levels in <i>Gracilinanus

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of environmental (dry
   versus wet season) and individual (sex, body mass and reproductive
   status) factors in the levels of faecal cortisol metabolites (FGCs) in
   Gracilinanus agilis faecal samples as an index of stress levels in this
   species; as well as its association with abundance of Eimeria spp, as an
   indicator of immunocompetence against parasites. Our study found that
   FGCFGCs are a reliable indicator of adrenal activity in G. agilis. We
   found that FGCFGCs increase considerably by environmental stressors like
   the dry season. Moreover, the observed positive association between FGCs
   and body mass is the result of the effect of season and reproduction in
   both variables. We also demonstrated that an increase in FGC levels
   among G. agilis during the dry season is associated with a rise in the
   probability of being infected by Eimeria spp. Hence, our finding
   supports the corticosteroid-fitness hypothesis, which predicts that
   increased glucocorticoids as a response to stressors usually results in
   decreased fitness of individuals, translated into low future survival
   and reproductive success, and higher parasite infection. To our
   knowledge, this is the first study that integrates environmental
   changes, hormone responses and parasite loads in a US marsupial in both
   empirical and experimental approaches.},

Title = {Get the most out of blow hormones: validation of sampling materials,
   field storage and extraction techniques for whale respiratory vapour
   samples},
Journal = {CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Studies are progressively showing that vital physiological data may be
   contained in the respiratory vapour (blow) of cetaceans. Nonetheless,
   fundamental methodological issues need to be addressed before hormone
   analysis of blow can become a reliable technique. In this study, we
   performed controlled experiments in a laboratory setting, using known
   doses of pure parent hormones, to validate several technical factors
   that may play a crucial role in hormone analyses. We evaluated the
   following factors: (i) practical field storage of samples on small boats
   during daylong trips; (ii) efficiency of hormone extraction methods; and
   (iii) assay interference of different sampler types (i.e. veil nylon,
   nitex nylon mesh and polystyrene dish). Sampling materials were dosed
   with mock blow samples of known mixed hormone concentrations
   (progesterone, 17 beta-estradiol, testosterone, cortisol, aldosterone
   and triiodothyronine), designed to mimic endocrine profiles
   characteristic of pregnant females, adult males, an adrenal
   glucocorticoid response or a zero-hormone control (distilled H2O).
   Results showed that storage of samples in a cooler on ice preserved
   hormone integrity for at least 6 h (P = 0.18). All sampling materials
   and extraction methods yielded the correct relative patterns for all six
   hormones. However, veil and nitex mesh produced detectable assay
   interference (mean 0.22 +/- 0.04 and 0.18 +/- 0.03 ng/ml, respectively),
   possibly caused by some nylon-based component affecting antibody
   binding. Polystyrene dishes were the most efficacious sampler for
   accuracy and precision (P < 0.001), but required an ethanol rinse for
   improved progesterone recovery (increased 81\%; P < 0.001). Awareness of
   assay interference from exogenous materials is crucial to future
   studies. This study establishes critical groundwork to help ensure that
   hormones can be measured accurately in samples obtained from field
   collections of whale blow.},
