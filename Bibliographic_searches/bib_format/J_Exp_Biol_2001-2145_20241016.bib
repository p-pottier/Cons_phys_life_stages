Abstract = {Bats, some species of rodents and some birds are able to save energy
   during the summer period by decreasing their body temperature and
   falling into torpor. Some studies indicate that torpor prevents sleeping
   and causes effects similar to sleep deprivation. Impairment of processes
   stabilizing memory slows down learning accuracy and speed. We conducted
   two experiments to test whether greater mouse-eared bats, Myotis myotis,
   which commonly use torpor during the summer period, experience a
   trade-off between energy savings and learning abilities. We compared
   learning speed and accuracy in bats that were exposed to low (7 degrees
   C) and higher ambient temperatures (22 degrees C) between training and
   experimental sessions. Tests were conducted in experiments with food
   reward (food search) and without food reward (perch search). Time spent
   with the skin temperature above 30 degrees C was significantly longer
   for bats exposed to 22 degrees C than for those exposed to 7 degrees C,
   and longer in experiments with food reward than without food reward. We
   observed only a very weak tendency for better accuracy and shorter
   search times in bats exposed to 22 degrees C than in those exposed to 7
   degrees C. Our data indicate that memory consolidation of bats under
   natural conditions is not affected by daily torpor when bats are in good
   condition and may therefore defend against a rapid fall into torpor. We
   suggest that homeostatic processes connected with the circadian rhythm
   allow protection of the consolidation of memory for relatively simple
   tasks despite time spent in torpor.},

Abstract = {Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by
   adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is
   partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component
   or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited
   resources over different demands, including immune function.
   Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes
   could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We
   tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread
   songbird, the stonechat (Saxicola torquata). We compared variation in
   immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance
   migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment.
   Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to
   temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We
   assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis,
   haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against Escherichia coli and
   Staphylococcus aureus. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of
   variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids
   differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies.
   Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and
   bactericidal ability against E. coli. We conclude that seasonal
   variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that
   heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune
   measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible.
   Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in
   constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and
   annualcycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering
   seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and
   life history of the organism of interest.},

Abstract = {Life history theory suggests that investment in reproduction can trade
   off against growth, longevity and both reproduction and performance
   later in life. One possible reason for this trade-off is that
   reproduction directly causes somatic damage. Oxidative stress, an
   overproduction of reactive oxygen species in relation to cellular
   defences, can correlate with reproductive investment and has been
   implicated as a pathway leading to senescence. This has led to the
   suggestion that this aspect of physiology could be an important
   mechanism underlying the trade-off between reproduction and lifespan. We
   manipulated female reproductive investment to test whether oxidative
   stress increases with reproduction in mice. Each female's pups were
   cross-fostered to produce litters of either two or eight, representing
   low and high levels of reproductive investment for wild mice. No
   differences were observed between reproductive groups at peak lactation
   for several markers of oxidative stress in the heart and gastrocnemius
   muscle. Surprisingly, oxidative damage to proteins was lower in the
   livers of females with a litter size of eight than in females with two
   pups or non-reproductive control females. While protein oxidation
   decreased, activity levels of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide
   dismutase increased in the liver, suggesting this may be one pathway
   used to protect against oxidative stress. Our results highlight the need
   for caution when interpreting correlative relationships and suggest that
   oxidative stress does not increase with enhanced reproductive effort
   during lactation.},

Abstract = {Most marine mammals are hypothesized to routinely dive within their
   aerobic dive limit (ADL). Mammals that regularly perform deep,
   long-duration dives have locomotor muscles with elevated myoglobin
   concentrations that are composed of predominantly large, slow-twitch
   (Type I) fibers with low mitochondrial volume densities (V-mt). These
   features contribute to extending ADL by increasing oxygen stores and
   decreasing metabolic rate. Recent tagging studies, however, have
   challenged the view that two groups of extreme deep-diving cetaceans
   dive within their ADLs. Beaked whales (including Ziphius cavirostris and
   Mesoplodon densirostris) routinely perform the deepest and longest
   average dives of any air-breathing vertebrate, and short-finned pilot
   whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) perform high-speed sprints at depth.
   We investigated the locomotor muscle morphology and estimated total body
   oxygen stores of several species within these two groups of cetaceans to
   determine whether they (1) shared muscle design features with other deep
   divers and (2) performed dives within their calculated ADLs. Muscle of
   both cetaceans displayed high myoglobin concentrations and large fibers,
   as predicted, but novel fiber profiles for diving mammals. Beaked whales
   possessed a sprinter's fiber-type profile, composed of similar to 80\%
   fast-twitch (Type II) fibers with low V-mt. Approximately one-third of
   the muscle fibers of short-finned pilot whales were slow-twitch,
   oxidative, glycolytic fibers, a rare fiber type for any mammal. The
   muscle morphology of beaked whales likely decreases the energetic cost
   of diving, while that of short-finned pilot whales supports high
   activity events. Calculated ADLs indicate that, at low metabolic rates,
   both beaked and short-finned pilot whales carry sufficient onboard
   oxygen to aerobically support their dives.},

Title = {Serotonin mediates stress-like effects on responses to non-nociceptive
   stimuli in the medicinal leech Hirudo verbana},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Noxious stimuli can elicit stress in animals that produce a variety of
   adaptations including changes in responses to nociceptive and
   non-nociceptive sensory input. One example is stress-induced analgesia
   that may be mediated, in part, by the endocannabinoid system. However,
   endocannabinoids can also have pro-nociceptive effects. In this study,
   the effects of electroshock, one experimental approach for producing
   acute stress, were examined on responses to non-nociceptive mechanical
   stimuli and nociceptive thermal stimuli in the medicinal leech (Hirudo
   verbana). The electroshock stimuli did not alter the leeches' responses
   to nociceptive stimuli, but did cause sensitization to non-nociceptive
   stimuli, characterized by a reduction in response threshold. These
   experiments were repeated with drugs that either blocked synthesis of
   the endocannabinoid transmitter 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or
   transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channel, which is known to
   act as an endocannabinoid receptor. Surprisingly, neither treatment had
   any effect on responses following electroshock. However, the
   electroshock stimuli reliably increased serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine
   or 5HT) levels in the H. verbana CNS. Injection of 5HT mimicked the
   effects of the electroshocks, sensitizing responses to non-nociceptive
   stimuli and having no effect on responses to nociceptive stimuli.
   Injections of the 5HT receptor antagonist methysergide reduced the
   sensitization effect to non-nociceptive stimuli after electroshock
   treatment. These results indicate that electroshocks enhance response to
   non-nociceptive stimuli but do not alter responses to nociceptive
   stimuli. Furthermore, while 5HTappearstoplayacritical role in this
   shock-induced sensitizing effect, the endocannabinoid system seems to
   have no effect.},

Title = {Insulin-like peptide 3 stimulates hemocytes to proliferate in
   anautogenous and facultatively autogenous mosquitoes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Most mosquito species are anautogenous, which means they must blood feed
   on a vertebrate host to produce eggs, while a few are autogenous and can
   produce eggs without blood feeding. Egg formation is best understood in
   the anautogenous mosquito Aedes aegypti, where insulin-like peptides
   (ILPs), ovary ecdysteroidogenic hormone (OEH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone
   (20E) interact to regulate gonadotrophic cycles. Circulating hemocytes
   also approximately double in abundance in conjunction with a
   gonadotrophic cycle, but the factors responsible for stimulating this
   increase remain unclear. Focusing on Ae. aegypti, we determined that
   hemocyte abundance similarly increased in intact blood-fed females and
   decapitated blood-fed females that were injected with ILP3, whereas OEH,
   20E or heat-killed bacteria had no stimulatory activity. ILP3
   upregulated insulin-insulin growth factor signaling in hemocytes, but
   few genes - including almost no transcripts for immune factors -were
   differentially expressed. ILP3 also stimulated circulating hemocytes to
   increase in two other anautogenous (Anopheles gambiae and Culex
   quinquefasciatus) and two facultatively autogenous mosquitoes (Aedes
   atropalpus and Culex pipiens molestus), but had no stimulatory activity
   in the obligately autogenous mosquito Toxorhynchites amboinensis.
   Altogether, our results identify ILPs as the primary regulators of
   hemocyte proliferation in association with egg formation, but also
   suggest this response has been lost in the evolution of obligate
   autogeny.},

Title = {Acoustic deterrents influence foraging activity, flight and echolocation
   behaviour of free-flying bats},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Acoustic deterrents have shown potential as a viable mitigation measure
   to reduce human impacts on bats; however, the mechanisms underpinning
   acoustic deterrence of bats have yet to be explored. Bats avoid ambient
   ultrasound in their environment and alter their echolocation calls in
   response to masking noise. Using stereo thermal videogrammetry and
   acoustic methods, we tested predictions that: (i) bats would avoid
   acoustic deterrents and forage and social call less in a `treated
   airspace'; (ii) deterrents would cause bats to fly with more direct
   flight paths akin to commuting behaviour and in line with a reduction in
   foraging activity, resulting in increased flight speed and decreased
   flight tortuosity; and (iii) bats would alter their echolocation call
   structure in response to the masking deterrent sound. As predicted,
   overall bat activity was reduced by 30\% and we recorded a significant
   reduction in counts of Pipistrellus pygmaeus (27\%), Myotis spp.
   (probably M. daubentonii) (26\%), and Nyctalus spp. and Eptesicus spp.
   (68\%) passes. Pipistrellus pygmaeus feeding buzzes were also reduced by
   the deterrent in relation to general activity (by 38\%); however, social
   calls were not (only 23\% reduction). Bats also increased their flight
   speed and reduced the tortuosity of their flight paths, and P. pygmaeus
   reduced echolocation call bandwidth and start frequency of calls in
   response to deterrent playback, probably owing to the masking effect of
   the sound. Deterrence could therefore be used to remove bats from areas
   where they forage, for example wind turbines and roads, where they may
   be under threat from direct mortality.},

Abstract = {Hibernation is characterized by depression of many physiological
   processes. To determine if this state is reversible in a non-food
   caching species, we fed hibernating grizzly bears (Ursus arctos
   horribilis) dextrose for 10 days to replace 53\% or 100\% of the
   estimated minimum daily energetic cost of hibernation. Feeding caused
   serum concentrations of glycerol and ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate) to
   return to active season levels irrespective of the amount of glucose
   fed. By contrast, free fatty acids (FFAs) and indices of metabolic rate,
   such as general activity, heart rate, strength of heart rate circadian
   rhythm, and insulin sensitivity were restored to approximately 50\% of
   active season levels. Body temperature was unaffected by feeding. To
   determine the contribution of adipose to the metabolic effects observed
   after glucose feeding, we cultured bear adipocytes collected at the
   beginning and end of the feeding and performed metabolic flux analysis.
   We found a similar to 33\% increase in energy metabolism after feeding.
   Moreover, basal metabolism before feeding was 40\% lower in hibernation
   cells compared with fed cells or active cells cultured at 37 degrees C,
   thereby confirming the temperature independence of metabolic rate. The
   partial depression of circulating FFAs with feeding likely explains the
   incomplete restoration of insulin sensitivity and other metabolic
   parameters in hibernating bears. Further depression of metabolic
   function is likely to be an active process. Together, the results
   provide a highly controlled model to examine the relationship between
   nutrient availability and metabolism on the hibernation phenotype in
   bears.},

Abstract = {Animals with high resting metabolic rates and low drag coefficients
   typically have fast optimal swim speeds in order to minimise energy
   costs per unit travel distance. The cruising swim speeds of sea turtles
   (0.5-0.6 m s(-1)) are slower than those of seabirds and marine mammals
   (1-2 m s(-1)). This study measured the resting metabolic rates and drag
   coefficients of sea turtles to answer two questions: (1) do turtles swim
   at the optimal swim speed?; and (2) what factors control the optimal
   swim speed of turtles? The resting metabolic rates of 13 loggerhead and
   12 green turtles were measured; then, the cruising swim speeds of 15
   loggerhead and 9 green turtles were measured and their drag coefficients
   were estimated under natural conditions. The measured cruising swim
   speeds (0.27-0.50 m s(-1)) agreed with predicted optimal swim speeds
   (0.19-0.32 m s(-1)). The resting metabolic rates of turtles were
   approximately one-twentieth those of penguins, and the products of the
   drag coefficient and frontal area of turtles were 8.6 times higher than
   those of penguins. Therefore, our results suggest that both low resting
   metabolic rate and high drag coefficient of turtles determine their slow
   cruising speed.},

Abstract = {Open-source technology has been increasingly used for developing
   low-cost animal-borne bio-loggers: however, a gap remains for a
   bio-logger that records both inertial movement and GPS positions. We
   address this need with the Tapered Wings Logger (TWLogger), an archival
   bio-logger that records high-resolution (e.g. 50 Hz) tri-axial
   accelerometry and magnetometry, temperature and GPS. The TWLogger can be
   built for 90 USD, accepts user-defined sampling parameters, and with a
   500 mA h battery weighs 25 g. We provide publicly available build
   instructions and custom analysis scripts. Bench tests recorded 50 Hz
   inertial movement and 2 min GPS for 31.8 +/- 2.2 h (mean +/- s.d., n=6)
   with GPS accuracy within 10.9 +/- 13.6 m. Field deployments on a
   medium-sized bird of prey in the wild achieved similar results (n=13).
   The customizable TWLogger has wide-ranging application across systems
   and thus offers a practical solution for eco-physiology applications.},

Title = {Energy turnover in mammalian skeletal muscle in contractions mimicking
   locomotion: effects of stimulus pattern on work, impulse and energetic
   cost and efficiency},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {222},

Abstract = {Active muscle performs various mechanical functions during locomotion:
   work output during shortening, work absorption when resisting (but not
   preventing) lengthening, and impulse (force-time integral) whenever
   there is active force. The energetic costs of these functions are
   important components in the energy budget during locomotion. We
   investigated how the pattern of stimulation and movement affects the
   mechanics and energetics of muscle fibre bundles isolated from wild
   rabbits (Otyctolagus cuniculus). The fibres were from muscles consisting
   of mainly fast-twitch, type 2 fibres. Fibre length was held constant
   (isometric) or a sinusoidal pattern of movement was imposed at a
   frequency similar to the stride frequency of running wild rabbits. Duty
   cycle (stimulation duration x movement frequency) and phase (timing of
   stimulation relative to movement) were varied. Work and impulse were
   measured as well as energy produced as heat. The sum of net work (work
   output-work input) and heat was taken as a measure of energetic cost.
   Maximum work output was produced with a long duty cycle and stimulation
   starting slightly before shortening, and was produced quite efficiently.
   However, efficiency was even higher with other stimulation patterns that
   produced less work. The highest impulse (considerably higher than
   isometric impulse) was produced when stimulation started while the
   muscle fibres were being lengthened. High impulse was produced very
   economically because of the low cost of producing force during
   lengthening. Thus, locomotion demanding high work, high impulse or
   economical work output or impulse requires a distinct pattern of
   stimulation and movement.},

Title = {Swimming strategies and energetics of endothermic white sharks during
   foraging},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {222},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Some fishes and sea turtles are distinct from ectotherms by having
   elevated core body temperatures and metabolic rates. Quantifying the
   energetics and activity of the regionally endothermic species will help
   us understand how a fundamental biophysical process (i.e.
   temperature-dependent metabolism) shapes animal ecology; however, such
   information is limited owing to difficulties in studying these large,
   highly active animals. White sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, are the
   largest fish with regional endothermy, and potentially among the most
   energy-demanding fishes. Here, we deployed multi-sensor loggers on eight
   white sharks aggregating near colonies of long-nosed fur seals,
   Arctocephalus forsteri, off the Neptune Islands, Australia. Simultaneous
   measurements of depth, swim speed (a proxy for swimming metabolic rate)
   and body acceleration (indicating when sharks exhibited energy-efficient
   gliding behaviour) revealed their fine-scale swimming behaviour and
   allowed us to estimate their energy expenditure. Sharks repeatedly dived
   (mean swimming depth, 29 m) and swam at the surface between deep dives
   (maximum depth, 108 m). Modal swim speeds (0.80-1.35 ms(-1)) were slower
   than the estimated speeds that minimize cost of transport (1.3-1.9
   ms(-1)), a pattern analogous to a `sit-and-wait' strategy for a
   perpetually swimming species. All but one shark employed unpowered
   gliding during descents, rendering deep (>50 m) dives 29\% less costly
   than surface swimming, which may incur additional wave drag. We suggest
   that these behavioural strategies may help sharks to maximize net energy
   gains by reducing swimming cost while increasing encounter rates with
   fast-swimming seals.},

Abstract = {High growth rate is associated with a short lifespan, but the
   physiological basis for this trade-off is not well known. Telomere
   length predicts individual lifespan and in this study we investigated
   whether embryonic growth rate, manipulated using incubation temperature,
   affects erythrocyte telomere length in a wild bird species, the common
   tern (Sterna hirundo). A 1 degrees C lower incubation temperature
   decreased growth rate by 5\%, without affecting size at hatching. The
   slower growth was associated with an average telomere length that was
   147 base pairs longer at hatching. If carried through to adulthood, this
   effect would correspond with an approximately 3 year longer lifespan.
   Our results thus suggest that an effect of growth rate on lifespan may
   be mediated by telomere dynamics or a physiological process reflected by
   telomere length.},

Title = {Respiratory consequences of targeted losses of <i>Hoxa5</i> gene
   function in mice},

Pages = {4571-4577},

Abstract = {Fetal development of the respiratory tract and diaphragm requires strict
   coordination between genetically controlled signals and mechanical
   forces produced by the neural network that generates breathing. HOXA5,
   which is expressed in the mesenchyme of the trachea, lung and diaphragm,
   and in phrenic motor neurons, is a key transcription factor regulating
   lung development and function. Consequently, most Hoxa5(-/-) mutants die
   at birth from respiratory failure. However, the extensive effect of the
   null mutation makes it difficult to identify the origins of respiratory
   dysfunction in newborns. To address the physiological impact of Hoxa5
   tissue-specific roles, we used conditional gene targeting with the
   Dermo1(Cre) and Olig2(Cre) mouse lines to produce specific Hoxa5
   deletions in the mesenchyme and motor neurons, respectively. Hoxa5
   expression in the mesenchyme is critical for trachea development,
   whereas its expression in phrenic motor neurons is essential for
   diaphragm formation. Breathing measurements in adult mice with
   whole-body plethysmography demonstrated that, at rest, only the motor
   neuron deletion affects respiration, resulting in higher breathing
   frequency and decreased tidal volume. But subsequent exposure to a
   moderate hypoxic challenge (F-IO2 = 0.12; 10 min) revealed that both
   mutant mice hyperventilate more than controls.
   Hoxa5(flox/flox);Dermo(1+/Cre) mice showed augmented tidal volume while
   Hoxa(5flox/flox);Olig(2+/Cre) mice had the largest increase in breathing
   frequency. No significant differences were observed between
   medulla-spinal cord preparations from E18.5 control and
   Hoxa(5flox/flox);Olig(2+/Cre) mouse embryos that could support a role
   for Hoxa5 in fetal inspiratory motor command. According to our data,
   Hoxa5 expression in the mesenchyme and phrenic motor neurons controls
   distinct aspects of respiratory development.},

Abstract = {To interpret the movement strategies employed in locomotion, it is
   necessary to understand the source of metabolic cost. Muscles must
   consume metabolic energy to do work, but also must consume energy to
   generate force. The energy lost during steady locomotion and, hence, the
   amount of mechanical work muscles need to perform to replace it can be
   reduced and, in theory, even eliminated by elastically storing and
   returning some portion of this energy via the tendons. However, even if
   muscles do not need to perform any mechanical work, they still must
   generate sufficient force to tension tendons and support body weight.
   This study shows that the metabolic cost per hop of human hopping can
   largely be explained by the cost of producing force over the duration of
   a hop. Metabolic cost determined via oxygen consumption is compared with
   theoretical predictions made using a number of different cost functions
   that include terms for average muscle work, force, force rate and
   impulse (time integral of muscle force). Muscle impulse alone predicts
   metabolic cost per hop as well as more complex functions that include
   terms for muscle work, force and force rate, and explains a large
   portion (92\%) of the variation in metabolic cost per hop. This is
   equivalent to 1/effective mechanical advantage, explaining a large
   portion (66\%) of the variation in metabolic cost per time per unit body
   weight. This result contrasts with studies that suggest that muscle
   force rate or muscle force rate per time determines the metabolic cost
   per time of force production in other bouncing gaits such as running.},

Abstract = {Combinations of stressors occur regularly throughout an animal's life,
   especially in agriculture and aquaculture settings. If an animal fails
   to acclimate to these stressors, stress becomes chronic, and a condition
   of allostatic overload arises with negative results for animal welfare.
   In the current study, we describe effects of exposing Atlantic salmon
   parr to an unpredictable chronic stressor (UCS) paradigm for 3 weeks.
   The paradigm involves exposure of fish to seven unpredictable stressors
   three times a day. At the end of the trial, experimental and control
   fish were challenged with yet another novel stressor and sampled before
   and 1 h after that challenge. Plasma cortisol decreased steadily over
   time in stressed fish, indicative of exhaustion of the endocrine stress
   axis. This was confirmed by a lower cortisol response to the novel
   stressor at the end of the stress period in chronically stressed fish
   compared with the control group. In the preoptic area (POA) and
   pituitary gland, chronic stress resulted in decreased gene expression of
   11 beta hsd2, gr1 and gr2 in the POA and increased expression of those
   genes in the pituitary gland. POA crf expression and pituitary
   expression of pomcs and mr increased, whereas interrenal gene expression
   was unaffected. Exposure to the novel stressor had no effect on POA and
   interrenal gene expression. In the pituitary, crfr1, pomcs, 11 beta
   hsd2, grs and mr were downregulated. In summary, our results provide a
   novel overview of the dynamic changes that occur at every level of the
   hypothalamicpituitary gland-interrenal gland (HPI) axis as a result of
   chronic stress in Atlantic salmon.},

Title = {Influence of reproductive mode on metabolic costs of reproduction:
   insight from the bimodal lizard <i>Zootoca vivipara</i>},

Abstract = {Examination of the selective forces behind the transition from oviparity
   to viviparity in vertebrates must include an understanding of the
   relative energy costs of the two reproductive modes. However,
   interspecific comparisons of reproductive mode are confounded by
   numerous other inherent differences among the species. Therefore, we
   compared oxygen consumption, as a reflection of energy costs, during
   reproduction in oviparous and viviparous females of the reproductively
   bimodal lizard Zootoca vivipara (Jaquin 1787). Female oxygen consumption
   progressively increased over the course of reproduction, peaking just
   prior to parition when it was 46\% (oviparous form) and 82\% (viviparous
   form) higher than it was at the pre-reproductive stage. Total increase
   in oxygen consumption (TIOC) during the pre-ovulation period was not
   different between the reproductive modes. Conversely, post-ovulation
   TIOC was more than three times higher in viviparous females, reflecting
   a dramatic increase in embryonic metabolism as well as maternal
   metabolic costs of pregnancy (MCP). MCP accounted for 22\% of total
   metabolism in viviparous females, whereas it was negligible in oviparous
   females. Our results demonstrate that egg retention through the first
   third of development, as is typical of most oviparous squamates, entails
   minimal maternal energy demand, while extending retention imposes much
   greater metabolic constraints. Selection for transition from oviparity
   to viviparity must therefore provide benefits that outweigh not only the
   added burden associated with prolonged embryonic retention, but also the
   substantial additional energy costs that are incurred.},

Abstract = {In the genome of Drosophila melanogaster, four genes coding for aldehyde
   oxidases (AOX1-4) were identified on chromosome 3. Phylogenetic analysis
   showed that the AOX gene cluster evolved via independent duplication
   events in the vertebrate and invertebrate lineages. The functional role
   and the substrate specificity of the distinct Drosophila AOX enzymes is
   unknown. Two loss-of-function mutant alleles in this gene region, low
   pyridoxal oxidase (Po-lpo) and aldehyde oxidase-1 (Aldox-1(n1)) are
   associated with a phenotype characterized by undetectable AOX enzymatic
   activity. However, the genes involved and the corresponding mutations
   have not yet been identified. In this study we characterized the
   activities, substrate specificities and expression profiles of the four
   AOX enzymes in D. melanogaster. We show that the Po-lpo-associated
   phenotype is the consequence of a structural alteration of the AOX1
   gene. We identified an 11-bp deletion in the Po-lpo allele, resulting in
   a frame-shift event, which removes the molybdenum cofactor domain of the
   encoded enzyme. Furthermore, we show that AOX2 activity is detectable
   only during metamorphosis and characterize a Minos-AOX2 insertion in
   this developmental gene that disrupts its activity. We demonstrate that
   the Aldox-1(n1) phenotype maps to the AOX3 gene and AOX4 activity is not
   detectable in our assays.},

Abstract = {Infection is an important source of mortality for avian embryos but
   parental behaviors and eggs themselves can provide a network of
   antimicrobial defenses. Mound builders (Aves: Megapodiidae) are unique
   among birds in that they produce heat for developing embryos not by
   sitting on eggs but by burying them in carefully tended mounds of soil
   and microbially decomposing vegetation. The low infection rate of eggs
   of one species in particular, the Australian brush-turkey (Alectura
   lathami), suggests that they possess strong defensive mechanisms. To
   identify some of these mechanisms, we first quantified antimicrobial
   albumen proteins and characterized eggshell structure, finding that
   albumen was not unusually antimicrobial, but that eggshell cuticle was
   composed of nanometer-sized calcite spheres. Experimental tests revealed
   that these modified eggshells were significantly more hydrophobic and
   better at preventing bacterial attachment and penetration into the egg
   contents than chicken eggs. Our results suggest that these mechanisms
   may contribute to the antimicrobial defense system of these eggs, and
   may provide inspiration for new biomimetic anti-fouling surfaces.},

Abstract = {Trade-offs between immune function and other physiological and
   behavioural processes are central in ecoimmunology, but one important
   problem is how to distinguish a reallocation of resources away from the
   immune system from a reallocation or redistribution within the immune
   system. While variation in baseline values of individual immune
   parameters is well established, studies in wild animals on multiple
   parameters during an immune response are lacking. It also remains to be
   tested whether and how immune responses correlate with baseline values
   that vary, for example, over the course of an annual cycle. We studied
   immunological responses to an endotoxin challenge in skylarks (Alauda
   arvensis), a partial migrant bird breeding in temperate zones. We
   compared birds injected with the endotoxin LPS with un-injected
   controls, characterizing immunological responses with leukocyte
   profiles, titres of lytic enzymes and natural antibodies, and
   concentrations of haptoglobin and heat shock proteins. We did this in
   five annual-cycle stages to test whether the response varied throughout
   the year. The endotoxin challenge affected six of 10 measured
   parameters. Lysis titres and proportions of heterophils increased;
   haptoglobin concentrations and proportions of lymphocytes, basophils and
   eosinophils decreased. The variable effects on different immune
   components demonstrate the complexity of an immune response. We found no
   evidence that the response differed between annual-cycle stages. The
   response was independent of baseline measures taken directly upon
   capture in the field, indicating that birds were facing no immunological
   ceiling when mounting an immune response. Values of five parameters
   collected under field conditions were significantly related to values
   taken under standardized laboratory conditions. We conclude that
   multiple parts of the immune system are modulated during an
   immunological response and that responses are not re-organized
   throughout the annual cycle.},

Title = {Neither male gonadal androgens nor female reproductive costs drive
   development of sexual size dimorphism in lizards},

Abstract = {Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is an extensively studied phenomenon in
   animals, including reptiles, but the proximate mechanism of its
   development is poorly understood. The most pervasive candidates are: (1)
   androgen-mediated control of growth, i.e. a positive effect of gonadal
   androgens (testosterone) on male growth in male-larger species, and a
   negative effect in female-larger species; and (2) sex-specific
   differences in energy allocation to growth, e.g. sex with larger
   reproductive costs should result in smaller body size. We tested these
   hypotheses in adults of the male-larger lizard Paroedura picta by
   conducting castrations with and without testosterone implants in males
   and manipulating reproductive status in females. Castration or
   testosterone replacement had no significant effect on final body length
   in males. High investment to reproduction had no significant effect on
   final body length in intact females. Interestingly, ovariectomized
   females and females with testosterone implants grew to larger body size
   than intact females. We did not find support for either of the above
   hypotheses and suggest that previously reported effects of gonadal
   androgens on growth in male lizards could be a consequence of altered
   behaviour or social status in manipulated individuals. Exogenous
   testosterone in females led to decreased size of ovaries; its effect on
   body size may be caused by interference with normal ovarian function. We
   suggest that ovarian factors, perhaps estrogens, not reproductive costs,
   can modify growth in female lizards and may thus contribute to the
   development of SSD. This hypothesis is largely supported by published
   results on the effect of testosterone treatment or ovariectomy on body
   size in female squamates.},

Title = {Male lake char release taurocholic acid as part of a mating pheromone},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The evolutionary origins of sexual preferences for chemical signals
   remain poorly understood, due, in part, to scant information on the
   molecules involved. In the current study, we identified a male pheromone
   in lake char (Salvelinus namaycush) to evaluate the hypothesis that it
   exploits a non-sexual preference for juvenile odour. In anadromous char
   species, the odour of stream-resident juveniles guides migratory adults
   into spawning streams. Lake char are also attracted to juvenile odour
   but have lost the anadromous phenotype and spawn on nearshore reefs,
   where juvenile odour does not persist long enough to act as a cue for
   spawning site selection by adults. Previous behavioural data raised the
   possibility that males release a pheromone that includes components of
   juvenile odour. Using metabolomics, we found that the most abundant
   molecule released by males was also released by juveniles but not
   females. Tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance were
   used to identify the molecule as taurocholic acid (TCA), which was
   previously implicated as a component of juvenile odour. Additional
   chemical analyses revealed that males release TCA at high rates via
   their urine during the spawning season. Finally, picomolar
   concentrations of TCA attracted pre-spawning and spawning females but
   not males. Taken together, our results indicate that male lake char
   release TCA as a mating pheromone and support the hypothesis that the
   pheromone is a partial match of juvenile odour.},

Title = {Hungry or angry? Experimental evidence for the effects of food
   availability on two measures of stress in developing wild raptor
   nestlings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Food shortage challenges the development of nestlings; yet, to cope with
   this stressor, nestlings can induce stress responses to adjust
   metabolism or behaviour. Food shortage also enhances the antagonism
   between siblings, but it remains unclear whether the stress response
   induced by food shortage operates via the individual nutritional state
   or via the social environment experienced. In addition, the
   understanding of these processes is hindered by the fact that effects of
   food availability often co-vary with other environmental factors. We
   used a food supplementation experiment to test the effect of food
   availability on two complementary stress measures, feather
   corticosterone (CORTf) and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio (H/L) in
   developing red kite (Mi/vus milvus) nestlings, a species with
   competitive brood hierarchy. By statistically controlling for the effect
   of food supplementation on the nestlings' body condition, we
   disentangled the effects of food and ambient temperature on nestlings
   during development. Experimental food supplementation increased body
   condition, and both CORTf and H/L were reduced in nestlings of high body
   condition. Additionally, CORTf decreased with age in non-supplemented
   nestlings. H/L decreased with age in all nestlings and was lower in
   supplemented last-hatched nestlings compared with non-supplemented ones.
   Ambient temperature showed a negative effect on H/L. Our results
   indicate that food shortage increases the nestlings' stress levels
   through a reduced food intake affecting both their nutritional state and
   their social environment. Thus, food availability in conjunction with
   ambient temperature shapes between- and within-nest differences in
   stress load, which may have carry-over effects on behaviour and
   performance in further life-history stages.},

Title = {Increased glucocorticoid concentrations in early life cause
   mitochondrial inefficiency and short telomeres},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Telomeres are DNA structures that protect chromosome ends. However,
   telomeres shorten during cell replication and at critically low lengths
   can reduce cell replicative potential, induce cell senescence and
   decrease fitness. Stress exposure, which elevates glucocorticoid hormone
   concentrations, can exacerbate telomere attrition. This phenomenon has
   been attributed to increased oxidative stress generated by
   glucocorticoids ('oxidative stress hypothesis'). We recently suggested
   that glucocorticoids could increase telomere attrition during stressful
   periods by reducing the resources available for telomere maintenance
   through changes in the metabolic machinery ('metabolic telomere
   attrition hypothesis'). Here, we tested whether experimental increases
   in glucocorticoid levels affected telomere length and mitochondrial
   function in wild great tit (Parus major) nestlings during the
   energy-demanding early growth period. We monitored resulting
   corticosterone (Cort) concentrations in plasma and red blood cells,
   telomere lengths and mitochondrial metabolism (metabolic rate, proton
   leak, oxidative phosphorylation, maximal mitochondrial capacity and
   mitochondrial inefficiency). We assessed oxidative damage caused by
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolites as well as the total
   non-enzymatic antioxidant protection in plasma. Compared with control
   nestlings, Cort-nestlings had higher baseline corticosterone, shorter
   telomeres and higher mitochondrial metabolic rate. Importantly,
   Cort-nestlings showed increased mitochondrial proton leak, leading to a
   decreased ATP production efficiency. Treatment groups did not differ in
   oxidative damage or antioxidants. Hence, glucocorticoid-induced telomere
   attrition is associated with changes in mitochondrial metabolism, but
   not with ROS production. These findings support the hypothesis that
   shortening of telomere length during stressful periods is mediated by
   glucocorticoids through metabolic rearrangements.},

Title = {Fatty acid composition and N<sub>2</sub> solubility in
   triacylglycerol-rich adipose tissue: the likely importance of intact
   molecular structure},

Abstract = {Diving tetrapods (sea turtles, seabirds and marine mammals) are a
   biologically diverse group, yet all are under similar constraints:
   oxygen limitation and increased hydrostatic pressure at depth. Adipose
   tissue is important in the context of diving because nitrogen gas (N-2)
   is five times more soluble in fat than in blood, creating a potential
   N-2 sink in diving animals. Previous research demonstrates that unusual
   lipid composition {[}waxes and short-chained fatty acids (FA)] in
   adipose tissue of some whales leads to increased N-2 solubility. We
   evaluated the N-2 solubility of adipose tissue from 12 species of diving
   tetrapods lacking these unusual lipids to explore whether solubility in
   this tissue can be linked to lipid structure. Across all taxonomic
   groups, the same eight FA accounted for 70-80\% of the entire lipid
   profile; almost all adipose tissues were dominated by monounsaturated FA
   (40.2-67.4 mol\%). However, even with consistent FA profiles, there was
   considerable variability in N2 solubility, ranging from 0.051 +/- 0.003
   to 0.073 +/- 0.004 ml N-2 ml(-1) oil. Interestingly, differences in N-2
   solubility could not be attributed to taxonomic group (P=0.06) or FA
   composition (P>0.10). These results lead to two main conclusions: (1) in
   triacylglycerol-only adipose tissues, the FA pool itself may not have a
   strong influence on N-2 solubility; and (2) samples with similar FA
   profiles can have different N-2 solubility values, suggesting that 3D
   arrangement of individual FA within a triacylglycerol molecule may have
   important roles in determining N-2 solubility.},

Title = {A tale of two genes: divergent evolutionary fate of haptoglobin and
   hemopexin in hemoglobinless Antarctic icefishes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {222},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The evolution of Antarctic notothenioid fishes in the isolated freezing
   Southern Ocean has led to remarkable trait gains and losses. One of the
   most extraordinary was the loss of the major oxygen carrier hemoglobin
   (Hb) in the icefishes (family Channichthyidae). Although the mechanisms
   of this loss and the resulting compensatory changes have been well
   studied, the impact of Hb loss on the network of genes that once
   supported its recycling and disposal has remained unexplored. Here, we
   report the functional fate and underlying molecular changes of two such
   key Hb-supporting proteins across the icefish family - haptoglobin (Hp)
   and hemopexin (Hx), crucial in removing cytotoxic free Hb and heme,
   respectively. Hp plays a critical role in binding free Hb for
   intracellular recycling and absent its primary client, icefish Hp
   transcription is now vanishingly little, and translation into a
   functional protein is nearly silenced. Hp genotype degeneration has
   manifested in separate lineages of the icefish phylogeny with three
   distinct nonsense mutations and a deletion frame shift, as well as
   mutated polyadenylation signal sequences. Thus, Hb loss appears to have
   diminished selective constraint on Hp maintenance, resulting in its
   stochastic, co-evolutionary drift towards extinction. Hx binds free heme
   for iron recycling in hepatocytes. In contrast to Hp, Hx genotype
   integrity is preserved in the icefishes and transcription occurs at
   levels comparable to those in the red-blooded notothenioids. The
   persistence of Hx likely owes to continued selective pressure for its
   function from mitochondrial and non-Hb cellular hemoproteins.},

Title = {Digestive and locomotor capacity show opposing responses to changing
   food availability in an ambush predatory fish},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {221},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Metabolic rates vary widely within species, but little is known about
   how variation in the `floor' {[}i.e. standard metabolic rate (SMR) in
   ectotherms] and `ceiling' {[}maximum metabolic rate (MMR)] for an
   individual's aerobic scope (AS) are linked with digestive and locomotor
   function. Any links among metabolic traits and aspects of physiological
   performance may also be modulated by fluctuations in food availability.
   This study followed changes in SMR, MMR, and digestive and locomotor
   capacity in southern catfish (Silurus meridionalis) throughout 15 days
   of food deprivation and 15 days of refeeding. Individuals downregulated
   SMR during food deprivation and showed only a 10\% body mass decrease
   during this time. Whereas critical swim speed (U-crit) was robust to
   food deprivation, digestive function decreased after fasting with a
   reduced peak oxygen uptake during specific dynamic action (SDA) and
   prolonged SDA duration. During refeeding, individuals displayed rapid
   growth and digestive function recovered to pre-fasting levels. However,
   refed fish showed a lower U-crit than would be expected for their
   increased body length and in comparison to measures at the start of the
   study. Reduced swimming ability may be a consequence of compensatory
   growth: growth rate was negatively correlated with changes in U-crit
   during refeeding. Southern catfish downregulate digestive function to
   reduce energy expenditure during food deprivation, but regain digestive
   capacity during refeeding, potentially at the cost of decreased swimming
   performance. The plasticity of maintenance requirements suggests that
   SMR is a key fitness trait for in this ambush predator. Shifts in trait
   correlations with food availability suggest that the potential for
   correlated selection may depend on context.},

Title = {Lowering metabolic rate mitigates muscle atrophy in western fence
   lizards},

Abstract = {Extended periods of skeletal muscle disuse can cause a significant loss
   of contractile proteins, which compromises the ability to generate
   force, mechanical work or power, thus compromising locomotor
   performance. Several hibernating organisms can resist muscle atrophy
   despite months of inactivity. This resistance has been attributed to a
   reduction in body temperature and metabolic rate and activation of
   physiological pathways that counteract pathways of protein degradation.
   However, in these systems, such strategies are not mutually exclusive
   and the effects of these mechanisms can be difficult to separate. In
   this study, we used the western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis,
   as an ectothermic model to determine whether a reduction in metabolic
   rate is sufficient to resist muscle atrophy. We induced atrophy through
   sciatic denervation of the gastrocnemius muscle and housed lizards at
   either 15 or 30 degrees C for 6-7 weeks. Following treatment, we used
   muscle ergometry to measure maximum isometric force, the force-velocity
   relationship and contractile dynamics in the gastrocnemius. This
   approach allowed us to relate changes in the size and morphology to
   functional metrics of contractile performance. A subset of samples was
   used to histologically determine muscle fiber types. At 30 degrees C,
   denervated muscles had a larger reduction in muscle mass, physiological
   cross-sectional area and maximum isometric force than at 15 degrees C.
   Maximum shortening velocity of the muscle decreased slightly in animals
   housed at 30 degrees C but did not change in those housed at 15 degrees
   C. Our results suggest that metabolic rate alone can influence the rate
   of muscle atrophy and that ectothermic vertebrates may have an intrinsic
   mechanism to resist muscle atrophy during seasonal periods of
   inactivity.},

Abstract = {The metabolic cost of breathing at rest has never been successfully
   measured in birds, but has been hypothesized to be higher than in
   mammals of a similar size because of the rocking motion of the avian
   sternum being encumbered by the pectoral flight muscles. To measure the
   cost and work of breathing, and to investigate whether species resident
   at high altitude exhibit morphological or mechanical changes that alter
   the work of breathing, we studied 11 species of waterfowl: five from
   high altitudes (>3000 m) in Peru', and six from low altitudes in Oregon,
   USA. Birds were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated in sternal
   recumbency with known tidal volumes and breathing frequencies. The work
   done by the ventilator was measured, and these values were applied to
   the combinations of tidal volumes and breathing frequencies used by the
   birds to breathe at rest. We found the respiratory system of
   high-altitude species to be of a similar size, but consistently more
   compliant than that of lowaltitude sister taxa, although this did not
   translate to a significantly reduced work of breathing. The metabolic
   cost of breathing was estimated to be between 1 and 3\% of basal
   metabolic rate, as low or lower than estimates for other groups of
   tetrapods.},

Title = {A crayfish molar tooth protein with putative mineralized exoskeletal

Abstract = {Some crustaceans possess exoskeletons that are reinforced with calcium
   carbonate. In the crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus, the molar tooth,
   which is part of the mandibular exoskeleton, contains an unusual
   crystalline enamel-like apatite layer. As this layer resembles
   vertebrate enamel in composition and function, it offers an interesting
   example of convergent evolution. Unlike other parts of the crayfish
   exoskeleton, which is periodically shed and regenerated during the molt
   cycle, molar mineral deposition takes place during the pre-molt stage.
   The molar mineral composition transforms continuously from fluorapatite
   through amorphous calcium phosphate to amorphous calcium carbonate and
   is mounted on chitin. The process of crayfish molar formation is
   entirely extracellular and presumably controlled by proteins, lipids,
   polysaccharides, low-molecular weight molecules and calcium salts. We
   have identified a novel molar protein termed Cq-M15 from C.
   quadricarinatus and cloned its transcript from the molar-forming
   epithelium. Its transcript and differential expression were confirmed by
   a next-generation sequencing library. The predicted acidic pI of Cq-M15
   suggests its possible involvement in mineral arrangement. Cq-M15 is
   expressed in several exoskeletal tissues at pre-molt and its silencing
   is lethal. Like other arthropod cuticular proteins, Cq-M15 possesses a
   chitin-binding Rebers-Riddiford domain, with a recombinant version of
   the protein found to bind chitin. Cq-M15 was also found to interact with
   calcium ions in a concentration-dependent manner. This latter property
   might make Cq-M15 useful for bone and dental regenerative efforts. We
   suggest that, in the molar tooth, this protein might be involved in
   calcium phosphate and/or carbonate precipitation.},

Abstract = {In stream-spawning salmonid fishes there is a considerable variation in
   the timing of when fry leave the spawning nests and establish a feeding
   territory. The timing of emergence from spawning nests appears to be
   related to behavioural and physiological traits, e.g. early emerging
   fish are bolder and more aggressive. In the present study, emerging
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) alevins were sorted into three
   fractions: early, intermediate and late emerging. At the parr stage,
   behaviour, stress responses, hindbrain monoaminergic activity and
   forebrain gene expression were explored in fish from the early and late
   emerging fractions (first and last 25\%). The results show that when
   subjected to confinement stress, fish from the late emerging fraction
   respond with a larger activation of the brain serotonergic system than
   fish from the early fraction. Similarly, in late emerging fish, stress
   resulted in elevated expression of mRNA coding for serotonin 1A
   receptors (5-HT1A), GABA-A receptor-associated protein and ependymin,
   effects not observed in fish from the early emerging fraction. Moreover,
   fish from the early emerging fraction displayed bolder behaviour than
   their late emerging littermates. Taken together, these results suggest
   that time of emergence, boldness and aggression are linked to each
   other, forming a behavioural syndrome in juvenile salmon. Differences in
   brain gene expression between early and late emerging salmon add further
   support to a relationship between stress coping style and timing of
   emergence. However, early and late emerging salmon do not appear to
   differ in hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis reactivity,
   another characteristic of divergent stress coping styles.},

Abstract = {Transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels are found
   throughout the animal kingdom, where they play an important role in
   sensory transduction. In this study, we combined physiological studies
   with in vivo behavioral experiments to examine the presence of a
   putative TRPV-like receptor in the medicinal leech, building upon
   earlier studies in this lophotrochozoan invertebrate. The leech
   polymodal nociceptive neuron was activated by both peripheral and
   central application of the TRPV1-activator capsaicin in a
   concentration-dependent manner, with 100 mu moll(-1) being the lowest
   effective concentration. Responses to capsaicin were inhibited by the
   selective TRPV1 antagonist SB366791. The polymodal nociceptive neuron
   also responded to noxious thermal stimuli (>40 degrees C), and this
   response was also blocked by SB366791. Capsaicin sensitivity was
   selective to the polymodal nociceptor with no direct response being
   elicited in the mechanical nociceptive neuron or in the non-nociceptive
   touch-or pressure-sensitive neurons. Capsaicin also elicited nocifensive
   behavioral responses (withdrawals and locomotion) in a
   concentration-dependent manner, and these behavioral responses were
   significantly attenuated with SB366791. These results suggest the
   presence of a capsaicin-sensitive TRPV-like channel in the medicinal
   leech central nervous system and are relevant to the evolution of
   nociceptive signaling.},

Abstract = {When animals move across a landscape, they alternate between active
   searching phases in areas with high prey density and commuting phases
   towards and in-between profitable feeding patches. Such active searching
   movements are more sinuous than travelling movements, and supposedly
   more costly in energy. Here we provide an empirical validation of this
   long-lasting assumption. To this end, we evaluated simultaneously energy
   expenditure and trajectory in northern gannets (Morus bassanus) using
   GPS loggers, dive recorders and three-dimensional accelerometers. Three
   behavioural states were determined from GPS data: foraging, when birds
   actively searched for prey (high tortuosity, medium speed); travelling,
   when birds were commuting (straight trajectory, high speed); and resting
   (straight trajectory, low speed). Overall dynamic body acceleration,
   calculated from acceleration data, was used as a proxy for energy
   expenditure during flight. The impact of windscape characteristics (wind
   force and direction) upon flight costs was also tested. Energy
   expenditure of northern gannets was higher during sinuous foraging
   flight than during more rectilinear travelling flight, demonstrating
   that turns are indeed costly. Yet wind force and direction also strongly
   shaped flight energy expenditure; within any behavioural state it was
   less costly to fly with the wind than against it, and less costly to fly
   with strong winds. Despite the major flight costs of wind action, birds
   did not fully optimize their flight track relative to wind direction,
   probably because of prey distributions relative to the coastline and
   wind predictability. Our study illustrates how both tortuosity and
   windscape shape the foraging costs of marine predators such as northern
   gannets.},

Abstract = {We compiled published values of mammalian maximum oxygen consumption
   during exercise ((V) over dot(O2,max)) and supplemented these data with
   new measurements of (V) over dot(O2,max) for the largest rodent
   (capybara), 20 species of smaller-bodied rodents, two species of weasels
   and one small marsupial. Many of the new data were obtained with
   running-wheel respirometers instead of the treadmill systems used in
   most previous measurements of mammalian (V) over dot(O2,max). We used
   both conventional and phylogenetically informed allometric regression
   models to analyze (V) over dot(O2,max) of 77 `species' (including
   subspecies or separate populations within species) in relation to body
   size, phylogeny, diet and measurement method. Both body mass and
   allometrically mass-corrected (V) over dot(O2,max) showed highly
   significant phylogenetic signals (i.e. related species tended to
   resemble each other). The Akaike information criterion corrected for
   sample size was used to compare 27 candidate models predicting (V) over
   dot(O2,max) (all of which included body mass). In addition to mass, the
   two best-fitting models (cumulative Akaike weight=0.93) included dummy
   variables coding for three species previously shown to have high (V)
   over dot(O2,max) (pronghorn, horse and a bat), and incorporated a
   transformation of the phylogenetic branch lengths under an
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of residual variation (thus indicating
   phylogenetic signal in the residuals). We found no statistical
   difference between wheel-and treadmill-elicited values, and diet had no
   predictive ability for (V) over dot(O2,max). Averaged across all models,
   the allometric scaling exponent was 0.839, with 95\% confidence limits
   of 0.795 and 0.883, which does not provide support for a scaling
   exponent of 0.67, 0.75 or unity.},

Title = {Inflammatory challenge increases measures of oxidative stress in a
   free-ranging, long-lived mammal},

Abstract = {Oxidative stress - the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   and neutralising antioxidants - has been under debate as the main cause
   of ageing in aerobial organisms. The level of ROS should increase during
   infection as part of the activation of an immune response, leading to
   oxidative damage to proteins, lipids and DNA. Yet, it is unknown how
   long-lived organisms, especially mammals, cope with oxidative stress.
   Bats are known to carry a variety of zoonotic pathogens and at the same
   time are, despite their high mass-specific basal metabolic rate,
   unusually long lived, which may be partly the result of low oxidative
   damage of organs. Here, we asked whether an immune challenge causes
   oxidative stress in free-ranging bats, measuring two oxidative stress
   markers. We injected 20 short-tailed fruit bats (Carollia perspicillata)
   with bacterially derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 20 individuals
   with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) as a control. Individuals
   injected with LPS showed an immune reaction by increased white blood
   cell count after 24 h, whereas there was no significant change in
   leukocyte count in control animals. The biological antioxidant potential
   (BAP) remained the same in both groups, but reactive oxygen metabolites
   (ROMs) increased after treatment with LPS, indicating a significant
   increase in oxidative stress in animals when mounting an immune reaction
   toward the inflammatory challenge. Control individuals did not show a
   change in oxidative stress markers. We conclude that in a long-lived
   mammal, even high concentrations of antioxidants do not immediately
   neutralise free radicals produced during a cellular immune response.
   Thus, fighting an infection may lead to oxidative stress in bats.},

Title = {The scaling of metabolic traits differs among larvae and juvenile
   colonies of scleractinian corals},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Body size profoundly affects organism fitness and ecosystem dynamics
   through the scaling of physiological traits. This study tested for
   variation in metabolic scaling and its potential drivers among corals
   differing in life history strategies and taxonomic identity. Data were
   compiled from published sources and augmented with empirical
   measurements of corals in Moorea, French Polynesia. The data compilation
   revealed metabolic isometry in broadcasted larvae, but size -independent
   metabolism in brooded larvae; empirical measurements of Pocillopora
   acuta larvae also supported sizeindependent metabolism in brooded coral
   larvae. In contrast, for juvenile colonies (i.e. 1-4 cm diameter),
   metabolic scaling was isometric for Pocillopora spp., and negatively
   allometric for Porites spp. The scaling of biomass with surface area was
   isometric for Pocillopora spp., but positively allometric for Porites
   spp., suggesting the surface area to biomass ratio mediates metabolic
   scaling in these corals. The scaling of tissue biomass and metabolism
   were not affected by light treatment (i.e. either natural photoperiods
   or constant darkness) in either juvenile taxa. However, biomass was
   reduced by 9-15\% in the juvenile corals from the light treatments and
   this coincided with higher metabolic scaling exponents, thus supporting
   the causal role of biomass in driving variation in scaling. This study
   shows that metabolic scaling is plastic in early life stages of corals,
   with intrinsic differences between life history strategy (i.e. brooded
   and broadcasted larvae) and taxa (i.e. Pocillopora spp . and Porites spp
   . ), and acquired differences attributed to changes in areanormalized
   biomass.},

Abstract = {Collective decisions have been extensively studied in arthropods, but
   they remain poorly understood in heterospecific groups. This study was
   designed to (1) assess the collective behaviours of blow fly larvae
   (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in groups varying in density and species
   composition, and (2) relate them to the costs and benefits of
   aggregating on fresh or decomposed food. First, experiments testing
   conspecific groups of Lucilia sericata and Calliphora vicina larvae, two
   species feeding at the same time on fresh carcasses, demonstrated
   decreases in growth and survival on rotten beef liver compared with
   fresh liver. However, mixing species together reduced this adverse
   impact of decomposition by increasing the mass of emerged adults.
   Second, larval groups were observed in binary choice tests between fresh
   and rotten liver (i.e. optimal and sub-optimal food sources). The
   results showed that larvae interacted with each other and that these
   interactions influenced their food preferences. We observed that (1)
   larvae were able to collectively choose the optimal food, (2) their
   choice accuracy increased with larval density and (3) the presence of
   another species induced a reversal in larval preference towards rotten
   food. These results highlight the ubiquity of collective decision
   properties in gregarious insects. They also reveal an unexpected effect
   of interspecific association, suggesting the colonization of new
   resources through a developmental niche construction.},

Abstract = {Blood flow patterns and heart rate have rarely been investigated in
   freely swimming turtles and their regulation during swimming is unknown.
   In this study, we investigated the blood flow patterns and heart rate in
   surfacing and during graded, submerged swimming activity in common
   snapping turtles. We further investigated the effects of beta-adrenergic
   and cholinergic receptor blockade on blood flow and heart rate during
   these activities. Our findings illustrate that surfacing is accompanied
   by an increase in heart rate that is primarily due to beta-adrenergic
   stimulation. During swimming, this mechanism also increases heart rate
   while vagal withdrawal facilitates a systemic to pulmonary (left to
   right) shunt. The results indicate there may be important taxonomic
   effects on the responses of cardiac function to activity in turtle
   species.},

Title = {Understanding diversity in oxidative status and oxidative stress: the
   opportunities and challenges ahead},

Abstract = {Oxidative stress may be of profound biological relevance. In this
   Commentary, I discuss some key issues faced by the emerging field of
   oxidative stress ecology, and seek to provide interpretations and
   solutions. First, I show that the way in which we define oxidative
   stress has far-reaching implications for the interpretation of results,
   and that we need to distinguish between (1) a biochemical definition in
   terms of the molecular outcomes of oxidative stress (e.g. generation of
   oxidative damage) and (2) a biological definition in terms of the
   fitness consequences for the organism (e.g. effects on fertility).
   Second, I discuss the dangers of comparing different tissues and
   markers. Third, I highlight the need to pay more attention to the
   cross-talk between oxidative stress and other important physiological
   costs and functions; this will allow us to better understand the
   mechanistic basis of fitness costs. Fourth, I propose the `redox
   signalling hypothesis' of life history to complement the current
   `oxidative stress hypothesis' of life history. The latter states that
   oxidative damage underlies trade-offs because it affects traits like
   growth, reproduction or cell senescence. By contrast, the redox
   signalling hypothesis states that a trade-off between signalling and
   biochemical oxidative stress underlies the regulation of reactive oxygen
   species production and their subsequent control. Finally, I critically
   appraise our current knowledge of oxidative stress ecology, highlighting
   key research themes and providing an optimistic overview of future
   opportunities for the discipline to yield considerable insight into the
   ecological and evolutionary meaning of oxidative stress.},

Abstract = {Cannabinoids are hypothesized to play an important role in modulating
   learning and memory formation. Here, we identified mRNAs expressed in
   Lymnaea stagnalis central nervous system that encode two
   G-protein-coupled receptors (Lymnaea CBr-like 1 and 2) that structurally
   resemble mammalian cannabinoid receptors (CBrs). We found that injection
   of a mammalian CBr agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN 55) into the snail before
   operant conditioning obstructed learning and memory formation. This
   effect of WIN 55 injection persisted for at least 4 days following its
   injection. A similar obstruction of learning and memory occurred when a
   severe traumatic stimulus was delivered to L. stagnalis. In contrast,
   injection of a mammalian CBr antagonist AM 251 enhanced long-term memory
   formation in snails and reduced the duration of the effects of the
   severe traumatic stressor on learning and memory. Neither WIN 55 nor AM
   251 altered normal homeostatic aerial respiratory behaviour elicited in
   hypoxic conditions. Our results suggest that putative cannabinoid
   receptors mediate stressful stimuli that alter learning and memory
   formation in Lymnaea. This is also the first demonstration that putative
   CBrs are present in Lymnaea and play a key role in learning and memory
   formation.},

Abstract = {The adaptive benefits of extended phenotypic plasticity are imprecisely
   defined due to a paucity of experiments examining traits that are
   manipulable and measurable across environments. Spider webs are often
   used as models to explore the adaptive benefits of variations in
   extended phenotypes across environments. Nonetheless, our understanding
   of the adaptive nature of the plastic responses of spider webs is
   impeded when web architectures and silk physicochemical properties
   appear to co-vary. An opportunity to examine this co-variation is
   presented by modifying prey items while measuring web architectures and
   silk physiochemical properties. Here, we performed two experiments to
   assess the nature of the association between web architectures and gluey
   silk properties when the orb web spider Argiope keyserlingi was fed a
   diet that varied in either mass and energy or prey size and feeding
   frequency. We found web architectures and gluey silk physicochemical
   properties to co-vary across treatments in both experiments.
   Specifically, web capture area co-varied with gluey droplet
   morphometrics, thread stickiness and salt concentrations when prey mass
   and energy were manipulated, and spiral spacing co-varied with gluey
   silk salt concentrations when prey size and feeding frequency were
   manipulated. We explained our results as A. keyserlingi plastically
   shifting its foraging strategy as multiple prey parameters
   simultaneously varied. We confirmed and extended previous work by
   showing that spiders use a variety of prey cues to concurrently adjust
   web and silk traits across different feeding regimes.},

Abstract = {At the beginning of their foraging lives, desert ants (Cataglyphis
   fortis) are for the first time exposed to the visual world within which
   they henceforth must accomplish their navigational tasks. Their habitat,
   North African salt pans, is barren, and the nest entrance, a tiny hole
   in the ground, is almost invisible. Although natural landmarks are
   scarce and the ants mainly depend on path integration for returning to
   the starting point, they can also learn and use landmarks successfully
   to navigate through their largely featureless habitat. Here, we studied
   how the ants acquire this information at the beginning of their outdoor
   lives within a nest-surrounding array of three artificial black
   cylinders. Individually marked `newcomers' exhibit a characteristic
   sequence of learning walks. The meandering learning walks covering all
   directions of the compass first occur only within a few centimeters of
   the nest entrance, but then increasingly widen, until after three to
   seven learning walks, foraging starts. When displaced to a distant test
   field in which an identical array of landmarks has been installed, the
   ants shift their search density peaks more closely to the fictive goal
   position, the more learning walks they have performed. These results
   suggest that learning of a visual landmark panorama around a goal is a
   gradual rather than an instantaneous process.},

Abstract = {We previously obtained evidence in rainbow trout for the presence and
   response to changes in circulating levels of glucose (induced by
   intraperitoneal hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic treatments) of
   glucosensing mechanisms based on liver X receptor (LXR), mitochondrial
   production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to increased
   expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), and sweet taste receptor in
   the hypothalamus, and on sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT-1) in
   hindbrain. However, these effects of glucose might be indirect.
   Therefore, we evaluated the response of parameters related to these
   glucosensing mechanisms in a first experiment using pooled sections of
   hypothalamus and hindbrain incubated for 6 h at 15 degrees C in modified
   Hanks' medium containing 2, 4 or 8 mmol l(-1) D-glucose. The responses
   observed in some cases were consistent with glucosensing capacity. In a
   second experiment, pooled sections of hypothalamus and hindbrain were
   incubated for 6 h at 15 degrees C in modified Hanks' medium with 8 mmol
   l(-1) D-glucose alone (control) or containing 1 mmol l(-1) phloridzin
   (SGLT-1 antagonist), 20 mu mol l(-1) genipin (UCP2 inhibitor), 1 mu mol
   l(-1) trolox (ROS scavenger), 100 mu mol l(-1) bezafibrate (T1R3
   inhibitor) and 50 mu mol l(-1) geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate (LXR
   inhibitor). The response observed in the presence of these specific
   inhibitors/antagonists further supports the proposal that critical
   components of the different glucosensing mechanisms are functioning in
   rainbow trout hypothalamus and hindbrain.},

Abstract = {Reproductive traits experience high levels of selection because of their
   direct ties to fitness, often resulting in rapid adaptive evolution.
   Much of the work in this area has focused on male reproductive traits.
   However, a more comprehensive understanding of female reproductive
   adaptations and their relationship to male characters is crucial to
   uncover the relative roles of sexual cooperation and conflict in driving
   co-evolutionary dynamics between the sexes. We focus on the physiology
   of a complex female reproductive adaptation in butterflies and moths: a
   stomach-like organ in the female reproductive tract called the bursa
   copulatrix that digests the male ejaculate (spermatophore). Little is
   known about how the bursa digests the spermatophore. We characterized
   bursa proteolytic capacity in relation to female state in the
   polyandrous butterfly Pieris rapae. We found that the virgin bursa
   exhibits extremely high levels of proteolytic activity. Furthermore, in
   virgin females, bursal proteolytic capacity increases with time since
   eclosion and ambient temperature, but is not sensitive to the pre-mating
   social environment. Post copulation, bursal proteolytic activity
   decreases rapidly before rebounding toward the end of a mating cycle,
   suggesting active female regulation of proteolysis and/or potential
   quenching of proteolysis by male ejaculate constituents. Using
   transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, we report identities for nine
   proteases actively transcribed by bursal tissue and/or expressed in the
   bursal lumen that may contribute to observed bursal proteolysis. We
   discuss how these dynamic physiological characteristics may function as
   female adaptations resulting from sexual conflict over female remating
   rate in this polyandrous butterfly.},

Abstract = {Juvenile hormone (JH) and dopamine are involved in the stress response
   in insects. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway
   has also recently been found to be involved in the regulation of various
   processes, including stress tolerance. However, the relationships
   between the JH, dopamine and insulin signalling pathways remain unclear.
   Here, we study the role of insulin signalling in the regulation of JH
   and dopamine metabolism under normal and heat stress conditions in
   Drosophila melanogaster females. We show that suppression of the
   insulin-like receptor (InR) in the corpus allatum, a specialised
   endocrine gland that synthesises JH, causes an increase in dopamine
   level and JH-hydrolysing activity and alters the activities of enzymes
   that produce as well as those that degrade dopamine {[}alkaline
   phosphatase (ALP), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-dependent
   arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (DAT)]. We also found that InR
   suppression in the corpus allatum modulates dopamine, ALP, TH and
   JH-hydrolysing activity in response to heat stress and that it decreases
   the fecundity of the flies. JH application restores dopamine metabolism
   and fecundity in females with decreased InR expression in the corpus
   allatum. Our data provide evidence that the insulin/insulin-like growth
   factor signalling pathway regulates dopamine metabolism in females of D.
   melanogaster via the system of JH metabolism and that it affects the
   development of the neuroendocrine stress reaction and interacts with JH
   in the control of reproduction in this species.},

Abstract = {Reef-building corals depend for much of their energy on photosynthesis
   by symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus Symbiodinium) that live within
   their gastrodermal cells. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning
   this ecologically critical symbiosis, including those governing the
   specificity of symbiont uptake by the host, remain poorly understood, in
   part because of the difficulties of working with corals in the
   laboratory. Here, we used the small symbiotic sea anemone Aiptasia as an
   experimentally tractable model system to analyze the specificity and
   timing of symbiosis onset in larval and adult animals under controlled
   laboratory conditions. Using four clonal, axenic Symbiodinium strains,
   we found no difference in uptake specificity between larvae (even when
   very young) and adults. Although both compatible and incompatible algal
   strains were found within the larval guts, only the former appeared to
   be internalized by gastrodermal cells, and they (but not incompatible
   algae) proliferated rapidly within the larvae in the absence of
   detectable exchange with other larvae. Older larvae showed reduced
   ingestion of both compatible and incompatible algae, and the addition of
   food failed to promote the uptake of an incompatible algal strain. Thus,
   Aiptasia adults and larvae appear to have similar mechanisms for
   discriminating between compatible and incompatible dinoflagellate types
   prior to phagocytosis by host gastrodermal cells. Whether a particular
   algal strain is compatible or incompatible appears to be stable during
   years of axenic culture in the absence of a host. These studies provide
   a foundation for future analyses of the mechanisms of symbiont-uptake
   specificity in this emerging model system.},

Abstract = {Anthropogenic noise has a negative impact on a variety of animals.
   However, many bat species roost in places with high levels of
   anthropogenic noise. Here, we tested the hypothesis that torpid bats are
   insensitive to anthropogenic noise. In a laboratory experiment, we
   recorded skin temperature (T-sk) of bats roosting individually that were
   subjected to playbacks of different types of noise. We found that torpid
   bats with T-sk similar to 10 degrees C lower than their active T-sk
   responded to all types of noise by elevating Tsk. Bats responded most
   strongly to colony and vegetation noise, and most weakly to traffic
   noise. The time of day when torpid bats were exposed to noise had a
   pronounced effect on responses. Torpid bats showed increasing responses
   from morning towards evening, i.e. towards the onset of the active
   phase. Skin temperature at the onset of noise exposure (T-sk,T-start,
   17-29 degrees C) was not related to the response. Moreover, we found
   evidence that torpid bats rapidly habituated to repeated and prolonged
   noise exposure.},

Abstract = {Evolutionary change in diapause timing can be an adaptive response to
   changing seasonality, and even result in ecological speciation. However,
   the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating shifts in diapause
   timing remain poorly understood. One of the hallmarks of diapause is a
   massive slowdown in the cell cycle of target organs such as the brain
   and primordial imaginal structures, and resumption of cell cycle
   proliferation is an indication of diapause termination and resumption of
   development. Characterizing cell cycle parameters between lineages
   differing in diapause life history timing may help identify molecular
   mechanisms associated with alterations of diapause timing. We tested the
   extent to which progression of the cell cycle differs across diapause
   between two genetically distinct European corn borer strains that differ
   in their seasonal diapause timing. We show the cell cycle slows down
   during larval diapause with a significant decrease in the proportion of
   cells in S phase. Brain-subesophageal complex cells slow primarily in
   G0/G1 phase whereas most wing disc cells are in G2 phase. Diapausing
   larvae of the earlier emerging, bivoltine E-strain (BE) suppressed cell
   cycle progression less than the later emerging, univoltine Z-strain (UZ)
   individuals, with a greater proportion of cells in S phase across both
   tissues during diapause. Additionally, resumption of cell cycle
   proliferation occurred earlier in the BE strain than in the UZ strain
   after exposure to diapause-terminating conditions. We propose that
   regulation of cell cycle progression rates ultimately drives differences
   in larval diapause termination, and adult emergence timing, between
   early- and late-emerging European corn borer strains.},

Abstract = {Diving bradycardia is a reduction in the heart rate mediated by the
   parasympathetic system during diving. Although diving bradycardia is
   pronounced in aquatic mammals and birds, the existence of this response
   in aquatic reptiles, including sea turtles, remains under debate. Using
   the parasympathetic blocker atropine, we evaluated the involvement of
   the parasympathetic nervous system in heart rate reduction of loggerhead
   sea turtles (Caretta caretta) during voluntary diving in tanks. The
   heart rate of the control group dropped by 40-60\% from the pre-dive
   value at the onset of diving; however, administration of atropine
   significantly inhibited heart rate reduction (P<0.001). Our results
   indicate that, similar to mammals and birds, the heart rate reduction in
   sea turtles while diving is primarily mediated by the parasympathetic
   nervous system. In conclusion, we suggest that diving bradycardia exists
   not only in aquatic mammals and birds but also in aquatic reptiles.},

Title = {Responses of activity rhythms to temperature cues evolve in
   <i>Drosophila</i> populations selected for divergent timing of eclosion},

Abstract = {Even though the rhythms in adult emergence and locomotor activity are
   two different phenomena that occur at distinct life stages of the fly
   life cycle, previous studies have hinted at similarities in certain
   aspects of the organisation of the circadian clock driving these two
   rhythms. For instance, the period gene plays an important regulatory
   role in both rhythms. In an earlier study, we have shown that selection
   on timing of adult emergence behaviour in populations of Drosophila
   melanogaster leads to the co-evolution of temperature sensitivity of
   circadian clocks driving eclosion. In this study, we investigated
   whether temperature sensitivity of the locomotor activity rhythm evolved
   in our populations separately from the adult emergence rhythm, with the
   goal of understanding the extent of similarity (or lack thereof) in
   circadian organisation underlying the two rhythms. We found that in
   response to simulated jetlag with temperature cycles, late chronotypes
   (populations selected for predominant emergence during dusk) indeed
   re-entrained faster than early chronotypes (populations selected for
   predominant emergence during dawn) to 6 h phase delays, thereby
   indicating enhanced sensitivity of the activity/rest clock to
   temperature cues in these stocks (entrainment is the synchronisation of
   internal rhythms to cyclic environmental time cues). Additionally, we
   found that late chronotypes show higher plasticity of phases across
   regimes, day-to-day stability in phases and amplitude of entrainment,
   all indicative of enhanced temperaturesensitive activity/rest rhythms.
   Our results highlight remarkably similar organisation principles between
   circadian clocks regulating emergence and activity/rest rhythms.},

Title = {Habituation of the cardiovascular response to restraint stress is
   inhibited by exposure to other stressor stimuli and exercise training},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {This study evaluated the effect of exposure to either a chronic variable
   stress (CVS) protocol or social isolation, as well as treadmill exercise
   training, in the habituation of the cardiovascular response upon
   repeated exposure to restraint stress in rats. The habituation of the
   corticosterone response to repeated restraint stress was also evaluated.
   For this, animals were subjected to either acute or 10 daily sessions of
   60 min of restraint stress. CVS and social isolation protocols lasted
   for 10 consecutive days, whereas treadmill training was performed for 1
   h per day, 5 days per week for 8 weeks. We observed that the increase in
   serum corticosterone was reduced during both the stress and the recovery
   period of the 10th session of restraint. Habituation of the
   cardiovascular response was identified in terms of a faster return of
   heart rate to baseline values during the recovery period of the 10th
   session of restraint. The increase in blood pressure and the decrease in
   tail skin temperature were similar at the 1st and 10th session of
   restraint. Exposure to CVS, social isolation or treadmill exercise
   training inhibited the habituation of the restraint-evoked tachycardia.
   Additionally, CVS increased the blood pressure response at the 10th
   session of restraint, whereas social isolation enhanced both the
   tachycardia during the first session and the drop in skin temperature at
   the 10th session of restraint. Taken together, these findings provide
   new evidence that pathologies evoked by stress might be related to
   impairment in the habituation process to homotypic stressors.},

Abstract = {Predicting the sensitivity of reef-building corals to disturbance,
   including bleaching, requires an understanding of physiological
   responses to stressors, which may be limited by destructive sampling and
   the capacity of common methodologies to characterize early life history
   stages. We developed a new methodology using laser scanning confocal
   microscopy (LSCM) to measure and track the physiological condition of
   corals. In a thermal stress experiment, we used LSCM to track coral
   condition during bleaching in adults and juveniles of two species,
   Montipora capitata and Pocillopora acuta. Depth of fluorescence in coral
   tissues provides a proxy measure of tissue thickness, whereas
   Symbiodiniaceae population fluorescence relates to both population
   density and chlorophyll a content. In response to thermal stress, there
   were significant shifts in tissue thickness and Symbiodiniaceae
   fluorescence with differences between life stages. This method is
   particularly well suited for detecting shifts in physiological condition
   of living corals in laboratory studies, especially in small juvenile
   colonies.},

Title = {An improved method for detecting torpor entrance and arousal in a
   mammalian hibernator using heart rate data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {221},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We used electrocardiogram (ECG) telemeters to measure the heart rate of
   hibernating Ictidomys tridecemlineatus (thirteen-lined ground squirrel).
   An increase in heart rate from 2.2 to 5 beats min(-1) accurately
   identified arousal from torpor before any change in body temperature was
   detected. Variability in raw heart rate data was significantly reduced
   by a forward-backward Butterworth low-pass filter, allowing for discrete
   differential analysis. A decrease in filtered heart rate to 70\% of
   maximum values in interbout euthermia (from approximately 312 to 235
   beats min(-1)) accurately detected entrance into torpor bouts. At this
   point, body temperature had fallen from 36.1 degrees C to only 34.7
   degrees C, much higher than the 30 degrees C typically used to identify
   entrance. Using these heart rate criteria allowed advanced detection of
   entrance and arousal (detected 51.9 and 76 min earlier, respectively),
   compared with traditional body temperature criteria. This method will
   improve our ability to detect biochemical and molecular markers
   underlying these transition periods, during which many physiological
   changes occur.},

Title = {The effects of 8 weeks voluntary wheel running on the contractile

   skeletal muscle during early ageing},

Abstract = {Decreased skeletal muscle performance with increasing age is strongly
   associated with reduced mobility and quality of life. Increased physical
   activity is a widely prescribed method of reducing the detrimental
   effects of ageing on skeletal muscle contractility. The present study
   used isometric and work loop testing protocols to uniquely investigate
   the effects of 8 weeks of voluntary wheel running on the contractile
   performance of isolated dynapenic soleus and diaphragm muscles of
   38-week-old CD1 mice. When compared with untrained controls, voluntary
   wheel running induced significant improvements in maximal isometric
   stress and work loop power, a reduced resistance to fatigue, but greater
   cumulative work during fatiguing work loop contractions in isolated
   muscle. These differences occurred without appreciable changes in
   lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, sarco-endoplasmic reticulum
   ATPase or myosin heavy chain expression synonymous with this form of
   training in younger rodent models. Despite the given improvement in
   contractile performance, the average running distance significantly
   declined over the course of the training period, indicating that this
   form of training may not be sufficient to fully counteract the
   longer-term ageing-induced decline in skeletal muscle contractile
   performance. Although these results indicate that regular low-intensity
   physical activity may be beneficial in offsetting the age-related
   decline in skeletal muscle contractility, future work focusing on the
   maintenance of a healthy body mass with increasing age and its effects
   on myosinactin cross-bridge kinetics and Ca2+ handling is needed to
   clarify the mechanisms causing the improved contractile performance in
   trained dynapenic skeletal muscle.},

Abstract = {Planktotrophic invertebrate larvae require energy to develop, disperse
   and settle successfully, and it is unknown how their energetics are
   impacted by turbulence. Ciliated larvae gain metabolic energy from their
   phytoplankton food to offset the energetic costs of growth, development
   and ciliary activity for swimming and feeding. Turbulence may affect the
   energetic balance by inducing behaviors that alter the metabolic costs
   and efficiency of swimming, by raising the encounter rate with food
   particles and by inhibiting food capture. We used experiments and an
   empirical model to quantify the net rate of energy gain, swimming
   efficiency and food capture efficiency for eyed oyster larvae
   (Crassostrea virginica) in turbulence. At dissipation rates
   representative of coastal waters, larvae lost energy even when food
   concentrations were very high. Both feeding activity and
   turbulence-induced behaviors incurred high metabolic costs. Swimming
   efficiency was concave up versus dissipation rate, suggesting that
   ciliary activity for food handling became more costly while swimming
   became more efficient with turbulence intensity. Though
   counter-intuitive, swimming may have become more efficient in turbulence
   because vorticity-induced rotation caused larvae to swim more
   horizontally, which requires less effort than swimming vertically
   against the pull of gravity. Overall, however, larvae failed to offset
   high activity costs with food energy gains because turbulence reduced
   food capture efficiency more than it enhanced food encounter rates.
   Younger, smaller larvae may have some energetic advantages, but
   competent larvae would lose energy at turbulence intensities they
   experience frequently, suggesting that turbulence-induced starvation may
   account for much of oysters' high larval mortality.},

Abstract = {In ripe fruit, energy mostly derives from sugar, while in over-ripe
   fruit, it also comes from ethanol. Such ripeness differences may alter
   the fitness benefits associated with frugivory if animals are unable to
   degrade ethanol when consuming over-ripe fruit. In the tropical
   butterfly Bicyclus anynana, we found that females consuming isocaloric
   solutions mimicking ripe (20\% sucrose) and over-ripe fruit (10\%
   sucrose, 7\% ethanol) of the palm Astrocaryum standleyanum exhibited
   higher fecundity than females consuming a solution mimicking unripe
   fruit (10\% sucrose). Moreover, relative to butterflies consuming a
   solution mimicking unripe fruit, survival was enhanced when butterflies
   consumed a solution mimicking either ripe fruit supplemented with
   polyphenols (fruit antioxidant compounds) or over-ripe fruit devoid of
   polyphenols. This suggests that (1) butterflies have evolved tolerance
   mechanisms to derive the same reproductive benefits from ethanol and
   sugar, and (2) polyphenols may regulate the allocation of sugar and
   ethanol to maintenance mechanisms. However, variation in fitness owing
   to the composition of feeding solutions was not paralleled by
   corresponding physiological changes (alcohol dehydrogenase activity,
   oxidative status) in butterflies. The fitness proxies and physiological
   parameters that we measured therefore appear to reflect distinct
   biological pathways. Overall, our results highlight that the energy
   content of fruit primarily affects the fecundity of B. anynana
   butterflies, while the effects of fruit consumption on survival are more
   complex and vary depending on ripening stage and polyphenol presence.
   The actual underlying physiological mechanisms linking fruit ripeness
   and fitness components remain to be clarified.},

Abstract = {Both economical locomotion and physical fighting are important
   performance traits to many species because of their direct influence on
   components of Darwinian fitness. Locomotion represents a substantial
   portion of the total daily energy budget of many animals. Fighting
   performance often determines individual reproductive fitness through the
   means of resource control, social dominance and access to mates.
   However, phenotypic traits that improve either locomotor economy or
   fighting ability may diminish performance in the other. Here, we tested
   for a predicted disparity between locomotor economy and competitive
   ability in wild-derived house mice (Mus musculus). We used 8 week social
   competition trials in semi-natural enclosures to directly measure male
   competitive ability through territorial control and female occupancy
   within territories. We also measured oxygen consumption during
   locomotion for each mouse using running trials in an enclosed treadmill
   and open-flow respirometry. Our results show that territory-holding
   males have higher absolute and mass-specific oxygen consumption when
   running (i.e. reduced locomotor economy) compared with males that do not
   control territories. This relationship was present both before and after
   8 week competition trials in semi-natural enclosures. This disparity
   between physical competitive ability and economical locomotion may
   impose viability costs on males in species for which competition over
   mates is common and may constrain the evolution of behavioral and
   phenotypic diversity, particularly in natural settings with
   environmental and resource variability.},

Abstract = {Experiments and observations were carried out to investigate the
   response of the Patella vulgata limpet shell to impact. Dropped-weight
   impact tests created damage that usually took the form of a hole in the
   shell's apex. Similar damage was found to occur naturally, presumably as
   a result of stones propelled by the sea during storms. Apex holes were
   usually fatal, but small holes were sometimes repaired, and the repaired
   shell was as strong as the original, undamaged shell. The impact
   strength (energy to failure) of shells tested in situ was found to be
   3.4-times higher than that of empty shells found on the beach.
   Surprisingly, strength was not affected by removing the shell from its
   home location, or by removing the limpet from the shell and allowing the
   shell to dry out. Sand abrasion, which removes material from the apex,
   was found to have a strong effect. Shells were also subjected to
   repeated impacts, which caused failure after 2-120 repetitions. In situ
   shells performed poorly in this test. It is proposed that the apex acts
   as a kind of sacrificial feature, which confers increased resistance but
   only for a small number of impacts. Microscopy showed that damage
   initiates internally as delamination cracks on low-energy interfaces,
   leading to loss of material by spalling. This mode of failure is a
   consequence of the layered structure of the shell, which makes it
   vulnerable to the tensile and shear stresses in the impact shock wave.},

Title = {The private life of echidnas: using accelerometry and GPS to examine

Abstract = {The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) is a monotreme and
   therefore provides a unique combination of phylogenetic history,
   morphological differentiation and ecological specialisation for a
   mammal. The echidna has a unique appendicular skeleton, a highly
   specialised myrmecophagous lifestyle and a mode of locomotion that is
   neither typically mammalian nor reptilian, but has aspects of both
   lineages. We therefore were interested in the interactions of locomotor
   biomechanics, ecology and movements for wild, free-living short-beaked
   echidnas. To assess locomotion in its complex natural environment, we
   attached both GPS and accelerometer loggers to the back of echidnas in
   both spring and summer. We found that the locomotor biomechanics of
   echidnas is unique, with lower stride length and stride frequency than
   reported for similar-sized mammals. Speed modulation is primarily
   accomplished through changes in stride frequency, with a mean of 1.39 Hz
   and a maximum of 2.31 Hz. Daily activity period was linked to ambient
   air temperature, which restricted daytime activity during the hotter
   summer months. Echidnas had longer activity periods and longer digging
   bouts in spring compared with summer. In summer, echidnas had higher
   walking speeds than in spring, perhaps because of the shorter time
   suitable for activity. Echidnas spent, on average, 12\% of their time
   digging, which indicates their potential to excavate up to 204 m(3) of
   soil a year. This information highlights the important contribution
   towards ecosystem health, via bioturbation, of this widespread
   Australian monotreme.},

Abstract = {Many arthropod species have evolved to thrive only on the leaves of a
   particular species of plant, which they must be capable of finding in
   order to survive accidental displacement, developmental transitions or
   the changing of the seasons. A number of studies have tested whether
   such species select leaves to land or oviposit on based on their color,
   shape or size. Unfortunately, many studies did not control for
   correlates of these characters, such as the brightness of different
   colors, the areas of different shapes, and the level of ambient
   illumination in the vicinity of different sizes of leaves. In the
   present study, we tested for leaf color, shape and size preferences in a
   leafd-welling jumping spider (Lyssomanes viridis) with known summer and
   winter host plants, while controlling for these correlates. First, color
   preferences were tested outdoors under the natural illumination of their
   forest habitat. Lyssomanes viridis did not prefer to perch on a green
   substrate compared with various shades of gray, but did prefer the
   second darkest shade of gray we presented them with. Of the green and
   gray substrates, this shade of gray's integrated photon flux (350-700
   nm), viewed from below, i.e. the spider's perspective in the arena, was
   the most similar to that of real leaves. This relationship also held
   when we weighted the transmitted photon flux by the jumping spiders'
   green photopigment spectral sensitivity. Spiders did not prefer the
   star-like leaf shape of their summer host plant, Liquidambar
   styraciflua, to a green circle of the same area. When given a choice
   between a L. styraciflua leaf-shaped stimulus that was half the area of
   an otherwise identical alternative, spiders preferred the larger
   stimulus. However, placing a neutral density filter over the side of the
   experimental arena with the smaller stimulus abolished this preference,
   with spiders then being more likely to choose the side of the arena with
   the smaller stimulus. In conclusion, L. viridis appears to use ambient
   illumination and possibly perceived leaf brightness but not leaf shape
   or color to locate its microhabitat. This calls for a careful
   re-examination of which visual cues a variety of arthropods are actually
   attending to when they search for their preferred host species or
   microhabitat.},

Abstract = {Crocodilians are apex amphibious predators that occupy a range of
   tropical habitats. In this study, we examined whether their semi-aquatic
   lifestyle and ambush hunting mode are reflected in specific adaptations
   in the peripheral visual system. Design-based stereology and
   microspectrophotometry were used to assess spatial resolving power and
   spectral sensitivity of saltwater (Crocodylus porosus) and freshwater
   crocodiles (Crocodylus johnstoni). Both species possess a foveal streak
   that spans the naso-temporal axis and mediates high spatial acuity
   across the central visual field. The saltwater crocodile and freshwater
   crocodile have a peak spatial resolving power of 8.8 and 8.0 cycles
   deg(-1), respectively. Measurement of the outer segment dimensions and
   spectral absorbance revealed five distinct photoreceptor types
   consisting of three single cones, one twin cone and a rod. The three
   single cones (saltwater/freshwater crocodile) are violet (424/426 nm
   lambda(max)), green (502/510 nm lambda(max)) and red (546/554 nm
   lambda(max)) sensitive, indicating the potential for trichromatic colour
   vision. The visual pigments of both members of the twin cones have the
   same lambda(max) as the red-sensitive single cone and the rod has a
   lambda(max) at 503/510 nm (saltwater/freshwater). The lambda(max) values
   of all types of visual pigment occur at longer wavelengths in the
   freshwater crocodile compared with the saltwater crocodile. Given that
   there is a greater abundance of long wavelength light in freshwater
   compared with a saltwater environment, the photoreceptors would be more
   effective at detecting light in their respective habitats. This suggests
   that the visual systems of both species are adapted to the photic
   conditions of their respective ecological niche.},

Abstract = {The polyphagous Drosophila suzukii is a highly invasive species that
   causes extensive damage to a wide range of berry and stone fruit crops.
   A better understanding of its biology and especially its behaviour will
   aid the development of new control strategies. We investigated the
   locomotor behaviour of D. suzukii in a semi-natural environment
   resembling a typical summer in northern England and show that adult
   female D. suzukii are at least 4-fold more active during daylight hours
   than adult males. This result was reproduced in several laboratory
   environments and was shown to be a robust feature of mated, but not
   virgin, female flies. Both males and virgin females kept on a 12 h
   light: 12 h dark (12LD) cycle and constant temperature displayed
   night-time inactivity (sleep) followed by weak activity in the morning,
   an afternoon period of quiescence (siesta) and then a prominent evening
   peak of activity. Both the siesta and the sharp evening peak at lights
   off were severely reduced in females after mating. Flies of either sex
   entrained in 12LD displayed a circadian pattern of activity in constant
   darkness confirming the importance of an endogenous clock in regulating
   adult activity. This response of females to mating is similar to that
   elicited in female Drosophila melanogaster by the male sex peptide (SP).
   We used mass spectrometry to identify a molecular ion (m/z, 5145)
   corresponding to the poly-hydroxylated SP of D. suzukii and to show that
   this molecule is transferred to the female reproductive tract during
   copulation. We propose that the siesta experienced by male and virgin
   female D. suzukii is an adaptation to avoid unnecessary exposure to the
   afternoon sun, but that mated females faced with the challenge of
   obtaining resources for egg production and finding oviposition sites
   take greater risks, and we suggest that the change in female behaviour
   is induced by the male SP.},

Abstract = {Physiological constraints dictate animals' ability to exploit habitats.
   For marine mammals, it is important to quantify physiological limits
   that influence diving and their ability to alter foraging behaviors. We
   characterized age-specific dive limits of walruses by measuring
   anaerobic (acid-buffering capacity) and aerobic (myoglobin content)
   capacities of the muscles that power hind (longissimus dorsi) and fore
   (supraspinatus) flipper propulsion. Mean buffering capacities were
   similar across muscles and age classes (a fetus, five neonatal calves, a
   3 month old and 20 adults), ranging from 41.31 to 54.14 slykes and 42.00
   to 46.93 slykes in the longissimus and supraspinatus, respectively. Mean
   myoglobin in the fetus and neonatal calves fell within a narrow range
   (longissimus: 0.92-1.68 g 100 g(-1) wet muscle mass; supraspinatus:
   0.88-1.64 g 100 g(-1) wet muscle mass). By 3 monthspost-partum,
   myoglobin in the longissimus increased by 79\%, but levels in the
   supraspinatus remained unaltered. From 3 months post-partum to
   adulthood, myoglobin increased by an additional 26\% in the longissimus
   and increased by 126\% in the supraspinatus; myoglobin remained greater
   in the longissimus compared with the supraspinatus. Walruses are unique
   among marine mammals because they are born with a mature muscle
   acid-buffering capacity and attain mature myoglobin content early in
   life. Despite rapid physiological development, small body size limits
   the diving capacity of immature walruses and extreme sexual dimorphism
   reduces the diving capacity of adult females compared with adult males.
   Thus, free-ranging immature walruses likely exhibit the shortest
   foraging dives while adult males are capable of the longest foraging
   dives.},

Abstract = {Body size is a central biological parameter affecting most biological
   processes (especially energetics) and the mitochondrion is a key
   organelle controlling metabolism and is also the cell's main source of
   chemical energy. However, the link between body size and mitochondrial
   function is still unclear, especially in ectotherms. In this study, we
   investigated several parameters of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the
   liver of three closely related species of frog (the common frog Rana
   temporaria, the marsh frog Pelophylax ridibundus and the bull frog
   Lithobates catesbeiana). These particular species were chosen because of
   their differences in adult bodymass. We found that mitochondrial
   coupling efficiency was markedly increased with animal size, which led
   to a higher ATP production (+70\%) in the larger frogs (L. catesbeiana)
   compared with the smaller frogs (R. temporaria). This was essentially
   driven by a strong negative dependence of mitochondrial proton
   conductance on body mass. Liver mitochondria from the larger frogs (L.
   catesbeiana) displayed 50\% of the proton conductance of mitochondria
   from the smaller frogs (R. temporaria). Contrary to our prediction, the
   low mitochondrial proton conductance measured in L. catesbeiana was not
   associated with higher reactive oxygen species production. Instead,
   liver mitochondria from the larger individuals produced significantly
   lower levels of radical oxygen species than those from the smaller
   frogs. Collectively, the data show that key bioenergetics parameters of
   mitochondria (proton leak, ATP production efficiency and radical oxygen
   species production) are correlated with body mass in frogs. This
   research expands our understanding of the relationship between
   mitochondrial function and the evolution of allometric scaling in
   ectotherms.},

Abstract = {Burrowing is an important form of locomotion in reptiles, but no study
   has examined the energetic cost of burrowing for reptiles. This is
   significant because burrowing is the most energetically expensive mode
   of locomotion undertaken by animals and many burrowing species therefore
   show specialisations for their subterranean lifestyle. We examined the
   effect of temperature and substrate characteristics (coarse sand or fine
   sand) on the net energetic cost of burrowing (NCOB) and burrowing rate
   in two species of the Egernia group of skinks (Liopholis striata and
   Liopholis inornata) compared with other burrowing animals. We further
   tested for morphological specialisations among burrowing species by
   comparing the relationship between body shape and retreat preference in
   Egernia group skinks. For L. striata and L. inornata, NCOB is 350 times
   more expensive than the predicted cost of pedestrian terrestrial
   locomotion. Temperature had a positive effect on burrowing rate for both
   species, and a negative effect on NCOB for L. striata but not L.
   inornata. Both NCOB and burrowing rate were independent of substrate
   type. Burrows constructed by skinks had a smaller cross-sectional area
   than those constructed by mammals of comparable mass, and NCOB of skinks
   was lower than that of mammals of similar mass. After accounting for
   body size, retreat preference was significantly correlated with body
   shape in Egernia group skinks. Species of Egernia group skinks that use
   burrows for retreats have narrower bodies and shorter front limbs than
   other species. We conclude that the morphological specialisations of
   burrowing skinks allow them to construct relatively narrow burrows,
   thereby reducing NCOB and the total cost of constructing their burrow
   retreats.},

Abstract = {Male-male aggression can have a large influence on access to mates,
   particularly in highly territorial animals such as mice. It has been
   suggested that males with impaired antioxidant defence and a
   consequential increased susceptibility to oxidative stress may have a
   reduced ability to invest in aggressive behaviours, which could limit
   their mating opportunities and reproductive success. Oxidative stress
   occurs as a result of an uncontrolled over-production of reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) in relation to defence mechanisms (such as antioxidants),
   and can cause damage to a variety of different cellular components.
   Impairments in specific aspects of antioxidant defence, leading to
   oxidative stress, can limit investment in some reproductive traits in
   males, such as sperm quality and the production of sexual signals to
   attract mates. However, a direct effect of impaired antioxidant defence
   on aggressive behaviour has not, to our knowledge, been reported. In
   this study, we demonstrate that mice with experimentally elevated
   sensitivity to oxidative stress (through inhibition of copper-zinc
   superoxide dismutase, Sod1) actually show the opposite response to
   previous predictions. Males completely deficient in SOD1 are more
   aggressive than both wild-type males and males that express 50\% of this
   antioxidant enzyme. They are also faster to attack another male. The
   cause of this increased aggression is unknown, but this result
   highlights that aggressive behaviour in mice is not highly constrained
   by inhibited Sod1 expression, in contrast to other reproductive traits
   known to be impaired in this mouse model.},

Abstract = {Fuel selection patterns during exercise are thought to be conserved
   among sea-level native mammals when intensity is expressed relative to
   maximum aerobic capacity ((V) over dotO(2, max)). However, this claim is
   based on data from only a few species larger than rats, and has never
   been tested statistically. Thus, we investigated fuel use in a small
   mammal (Mus musculus, CD-1 strain), and combined these data with
   published data on rats, dogs, goats and humans to evaluate the
   robustness of the mammalian fuel selection model. We found that mice
   rely less on carbohydrates to power moderate intensity exercise at the
   same \% (V) over dotO(2, max), max than larger mammals. We suggest that
   this difference is due to a decline in aerobic scope (O-2 available for
   exercise above resting metabolism) as body size decreases. We propose a
   redefined fuel use model that reflects changes in fractional aerobic
   scope with body size. Our results indicate that exercise defined as
   percent aerobic scope is a better predictor of fuel use across a wide
   range of quadruped species from mice to dogs and running humans.},

Abstract = {Circannual rhythms regulate seasonal reproduction in many vertebrates.
   The present study investigated whether circannual reproductive
   phenotypes (rhythms in growth of gonads and molt) were generated
   independently of the circadian clocks in the subtropical
   non-photoperiodic spotted munia (Lonchura punctulata). Birds were
   subjected to light: dark (LD) cycles with identical light but varying
   dark hours, such that the period of LD cycle (T) equaled 16 h (T16; 12 h
   L: 4 h D), 21 h (T21; 12 h L: 9 h D), 24 h (T24; 12 h L: 12 h D) and 27
   h (T27; 12 h L: 15 h D), or to continuous light (LL, 24 h L: 0 h D) at
   similar to 18 degrees C. During the similar to 21 month exposure, munia
   underwent at least two cycles of gonadal development and molt; changes
   in body mass were not rhythmic. This was similar to the occurrence of
   annual cycles in reproduction and molt observed in wild birds. A greater
   asynchrony between circannual cycles of gonad development and molt
   indicated their independent regulation. Females showed reproductive
   rhythms with similar circannual periods, whilst in males, circannual
   periods measured between peak gonadal size were longer in T21 and T24
   than in T16 or T27. This suggested a sex-dependent timing of annual
   reproduction in the spotted munia. Also, food availability periods may
   not influence the circannual timing of reproduction, as shown by the
   results on the rhythm in gonadal growth and regression in munia under
   T-photocycles and LL that provided differential light (feeding) hours.
   Further, a short-term experiment revealed that activity-rest patterns in
   munia were synchronized with T-photocycles, but were arrhythmic under
   LL. We conclude that circadian rhythms are not involved in the timing of
   the annual reproductive cycle in the spotted munia.},

Abstract = {Satellite cells (SCs), stem cells in skeletal muscle, are mitotically
   quiescent in adult mammals until activated for growth or regeneration.
   In mouse muscle, SCs are activated by nitric oxide (NO), hepatocyte
   growth factor (HGF) and the mechanically induced NO-HGF signaling
   cascade. Here, the SC population on fibers from the adult, ectothermic
   zebrafish and SC responsiveness to activating stimuli were assessed
   using the model system of isolated fibers cultured at 27 and 21 degrees
   C. SCs were identified by immunostaining for the HGF receptor, c-met,
   and activation was determined using bromodeoxyuridine uptake in culture
   or in vivo. In dose-response studies, SC activation was increased by
   treatment with the NO-donor drug isosorbide dinitrate (1 mmol l(-1)) or
   HGF (10 ng ml(-1)) to maximum activation at lower concentrations of both
   than in previous studies of mouse fibers. HGF-induced activation was
   blocked by anti-c-met antibody, and reduced by culture at 21 degrees C.
   The effect of cyclical stretch (3 h at 4 cycles per minute) increased
   activation and was blocked by nitric oxide synthase inhibition and
   reduced by culture at 21 degrees C. The number of c-met+ SCs per fiber
   increased rapidly (by 3 h) after stretching. The character of signaling
   in SC activation on zebrafish fibers, in particular
   temperature-dependent responses to HGF and stretch, gives new insights
   into the influence of ectothermy on regulation of muscle growth in
   teleosts and suggests the use of the single-fiber model system to
   explore the basis of fiber hyperplasia and the conservation of
   regulatory pathways between species.},

Abstract = {Most animals store energy as long-chain triacylglycerols (IcTAGs). Trace
   amounts of acetylated triacylglycerols (acTAGs) have been reported in
   animals, but are not accumulated, likely because they have lower energy
   density than IcTAGs. Here we report that acTAGs comprise 36\% of the
   neutral lipid pool of overwintering prepupae of the goldenrod gall fly,
   Eurosta solidaginis, while only 17\% of the neutral lipid pool is made
   up of typical IcTAGs. These high concentrations of acTAGs, present only
   during winter, appear to be synthesized by E. solidaginis and are not
   found in other freeze-tolerant insects, nor in the plant host. The
   mixture of acTAGs found in E. solidaginis has a significantly lower
   melting point than equivalent IcTAGs, and thus remains liquid at
   temperatures at which E. solidaginis is frozen in the field, and
   depresses the melting point of aqueous solutions in a manner unusual for
   neutral lipids. We note that accumulation of acTAGs coincides with
   preparation for overwintering and the seasonal acquisition of freeze
   tolerance. This is the first observation of accumulation of acTAGs by an
   animal, and the first evidence of dynamic interconversion between acTAGs
   and IcTAGs during development and in response to stress.},

Abstract = {The cheetah is considered the fastest land animal, but studies on their
   skeletal muscle properties are scarce. Vastus lateralis biopsies,
   obtained from male and female cheetahs as well as humans, were analysed
   and compared for fibre type and size, and metabolism. Overall, cheetah
   muscle had predominantly type IIX fibres, which was confirmed by the
   myosin heavy chain isoform content (mean +/- s.d. type I: 17 +/- 8\%,
   type IIA: 21 +/- 6\%, type IIX: 62 +/- 12\%), whereas human muscle
   contained predominantly type I and IIA fibres (type I: 49 +/- 14\%, type
   IIA: 43 +/- 8\%, type IIX: 7 +/- 7\%). Cheetahs had smaller fibres than
   humans, with larger fibres in the males compared with their female
   counterparts. Citrate synthase (16 +/- 6 versus 28 +/- 7 mu mol min(-1)
   g(-1) protein, P<0.05) and 3-hydroxyacyl co-enzyme A dehydrogenase (30
   +/- 11 versus 47 +/- 15 <mu>mol min(-1) g(-1) protein, P<0.05)
   activities were lower in cheetahs than in humans, whereas lactate
   dehydrogenase activity was 6 times higher in cheetahs (2159 +/- 827
   versus 382 +/- 161 <mu>mol min(-1) g(-1) protein, P<0.001). The
   activities of creatine kinase (4765 +/- 1828 versus 6485 +/- 1298,
   P<0.05 mu mol min(-1) g(-1) protein) and phosphorylase (111 +/- 29
   versus 216 +/- 92 mu mol min(-1) g(-1) protein) were higher in humans,
   irrespective of the higher type IIX fibres in cheetahs. Superoxide
   dismutase and catalase, markers of antioxidant capacity, were higher in
   humans, but overall antioxidant capacity was higher in cheetahs. To
   conclude, fibre type, fibre size and metabolism differ between cheetahs
   and humans, with limited differences between the sexes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Despite the potential for temporally dependent relationships between
   trait values and fitness (e.g. as juveniles approach life-stage
   transitions such as fledging), how developmental stage affects
   canalization (a measure of robustness to environmental variation) of
   morphological and physiological traits is rarely considered. To test the
   sensitivity of morphological and physiological traits to environmental
   variation in two developmental stages, we manipulated brood size at
   hatch in European starlings (Sturnus vulgans) and cross-fostered chicks
   between enlarged and reduced broods approaching fledging. We measured
   body size (mass, tarsus, wing length) and physiological state (aerobic
   capacity, oxidative status) at asymptotic mass on day 15, then
   cross-fostered chicks between `high' and `low' quality environments and
   assessed the same traits again on day 20, after 5 days of pre-fledging
   mass recession. Chicks in reduced broods were heavier at asymptotic mass
   and had lower reactive oxygen metabolites than enlarged broods, whereas
   structural size, aerobic capacity and antioxidant capacity were
   unaffected by experimental brood size. The observed canalization of
   structural and physiological traits during early development was
   maintained after cross-fostering, during late development. However, in
   contrast to early development, antioxidant capacity approaching fledging
   appeared sensitive to environmental conditions, as trajectories varied
   by cross-fostering treatment. Elevated reactive oxygen metabolites
   observed after early development in enlarged brood chicks were
   maintained after cross fostering, suggesting that canalized development
   in low-quality environments could produce oxidative costs that carry
   over between life stages, even when conditions improve. These data
   reveal trait specific relationships between environmental conditions and
   development, and highlight how natal environment effects may vary by
   developmental stage.},

Abstract = {Wild animals have parasites that can compromise their physiological
   and/or behavioural performance. Yet, the extent to which parasite load
   is related to intraspecific variation in performance traits within wild
   populations remains relatively unexplored. We used pumpkinseed sunfish
   (Lepomis gibbosus) and their endoparasites as a model system to explore
   the effects of infection load on host aerobic metabolism and escape
   performance. Metabolic traits (standard and maximum metabolic rates,
   aerobic scope) and faststart escape responses following a simulated
   aerial attack by a predator (responsiveness, response latency and escape
   distance) were measured in fish from across a gradient of visible (i.e.
   trematodes causing black spot disease counted on fish surfaces) and
   non-visible (i.e. cestodes in fish abdominal cavity counted post-mortem)
   endoparasite infection. We found that a higher infection load of
   non-visible endoparasites was related to lower standard and maximum
   metabolic rates, but not aerobic scope in fish. Non-visible endoparasite
   infection load was also related to decreased responsiveness of the host
   to a simulated aerial attack. Visible endoparasites were not related to
   changes in metabolic traits or fast-start escape responses. Our results
   suggest that infection with parasites that are inconspicuous to
   researchers can result in intraspecific variation in physiological and
   behavioural performance in wild populations. highlighting the need to
   more explicitly acknowledge and account for the role played by natural
   infections in studies of wild animal performance.},

Title = {Flying on empty: reduced mitochondrial function and flight capacity in
   food-deprived monarch butterflies},

Abstract = {Mitochondrial function is fundamental to organismal performance, health
   and fitness - especially during energetically challenging events, such
   as migration. With this investigation, we evaluated mitochondrial
   sensitivity to ecologically relevant stressors. We focused on an iconic
   migrant, the North American monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), and
   examined the effects of two stressors: 7 days of food deprivation and
   infection by the protozoan parasite Optuyocystis elektroscirrha (known
   to reduce survival and flight performance). We measured whole-animal
   resting metabolic rate (RMR) and peak flight metabolic rate, and
   mitochondrial respiration of isolated mitochondria from the flight
   muscles. Food deprivation reduced mass-independent RMR and peak flight
   metabolic rate, whereas infection did not. Fed monarchs used mainly
   lipids in flight (respiratory quotient 0.73), but the respiratory
   quotient dropped in food-deprived individuals, possibly indicating
   switching to alternative energy sources, such as ketone bodies. Food
   deprivation decreased mitochondrial maximum oxygen consumption but not
   basal respiration, resulting in lower respiratory control ratio (RCR).
   Furthermore, food deprivation decreased mitochondrial complex III
   activity, but increased complex IV activity. Infection did not result in
   any changes in these mitochondrial variables. Mitochondrial maximum
   respiration rate correlated positively with mass-independent RMR and
   flight metabolic rate, suggesting a link between mitochondria and
   whole-animal performance. In conclusion, low food availability
   negatively affects mitochondrial function and flight performance. with
   potential implications for migration, fitness and population dynamics.
   Although previous studies have reported poor flight performance in
   infected monarchs, we found no differences in physiological performance,
   suggesting that reduced flight capacity may be due to structural
   differences or low energy stores.},

Abstract = {Cryoprotection is of interest in many fields of research, necessitating
   a greater understanding of different cryoprotective agents. Antifreeze
   proteins have been identified that have the ability to confer
   cryoprotection in certain organisms. Antifreeze proteins are an
   evolutionary adaptation that contributes to the freeze resistance of
   certain fish, insects, bacteria and plants. These proteins adsorb to an
   ice crystal's surface and restrict its growth within a certain
   temperature range. We investigated the ability of an antifreeze protein
   from the desert beetle Anatolica polita, ApAFP752, to confer
   cryoprotection in the frog Xenopus laevis. Xenopus laevis eggs and
   embryos microinjected with ApAFP752 exhibited reduced damage and
   increased survival after a freeze-thaw cycle in a
   concentration-dependent manner. We also demonstrate that ApAFP752
   localizes to the plasma membrane in eggs and embryonic blastomeres and
   is not toxic for early development. These studies show the potential of
   an insect antifreeze protein to confer cryoprotection in amphibian eggs
   and embryos.},

Abstract = {An unavoidable consequence of aerobic metabolism is the production of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondria have historically been
   considered the primary source of ROS; however, recent literature has
   highlighted the uncertainty in primary ROS production sites and it is
   unclear how variation in mitochondrial density influences ROS-induced
   damage and protein turnover. Fish skeletal muscle is composed of
   distinct, highly aerobic red muscle and anaerobic white muscle, offering
   an excellent model system in which to evaluate the relationship of
   tissue aerobic capacity and ROS-induced damage under baseline
   conditions. The present study used a suite of indices to better
   understand potential consequences of aerobic tissue capacity in red and
   white muscle of the pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides. Red muscle had a 7-fold
   greater mitochondrial volume density thanwhite muscle, andmore oxidative
   damage despite also having higher activity of the antioxidant enzymes
   superoxide dismutase and catalase. The dominant protein degradation
   system appears to be tissue dependent. Lysosomal degradation markers and
   autophagosome volume density were greater in white muscle, while
   ubiquitin expression and 20S proteasome activity were significantly
   greater in red muscle. However, ubiquitin ligase expression was
   significantly higher inwhite muscle. Redmuscle had a more than 2-fold
   greater rate of translation and total ATP turnover than white muscle,
   results that may be due in part to the higher mitochondrial density and
   the associated increase in oxidative damage. Together, these results
   support the concept that an elevated aerobic capacity is associated with
   greater oxidative damage and higher costs of protein turnover.},

Title = {Prenatal independent and combined effects of yolk vitamin E and
   corticosterone on embryo growth and oxidative status in the
   yellow-legged gull},

Abstract = {Variation in the concentration of antioxidants and hormones of maternal
   origin in the eggs of birds can have a profound influence on offspring
   phenotype both prenatally and postnatally. Egg maternal substances can
   have interacting effects, but experimental studies of the consequences
   of the combined variation in the egg concentration of such molecules are
   extremely rare, particularly as far as prenatal stages are concerned. We
   manipulated the yolk concentration of vitamin E and corticosterone,
   which are, respectively, the main antioxidant and the main
   glucocorticoid hormone in bird eggs, both independently and
   simultaneously, and we tested their separate and combined effects on
   growth and oxidative status in the liver and in the brain of
   yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) embryos. Egg supplementation of
   relatively large physiological doses of corticosterone depressed embryo
   growth (total body mass, tarsus length and liver mass), whereas
   administration of vitamin E in association with corticosterone restored
   normal growth. Vitamin E did not affect embryo growth when administered
   alone. We further analysed the independent and combined effects of
   vitamin E and corticosterone on liver and brain total antioxidant
   capacity, the concentration of reactive oxygen molecules and lipid
   peroxidation. Vitamin E significantly reduced liver total antioxidant
   capacity, while corticosterone depressed brain lipid peroxidation.
   Prenatal exposure to vitamin E and corticosterone appears to have
   antagonistic effects on body growth, although vitamin E is not limiting
   in yellow-legged gull eggs. In combination with the results of previous
   experiments on the same species applying smaller experimental doses or
   focusing on the postnatal rather than prenatal life stages, our findings
   indicate that the effects of a physiological increase in the egg
   concentration of these substances can be life stage and dose specific,
   implying that generalizing prenatal effects of egg compounds may not be
   feasible.},

Title = {Visual approach computation in feeding hoverflies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {221},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {On warm sunny days, female hoverflies are often observed feeding from a
   wide range of wild and cultivated flowers. In doing so, hoverflies serve
   a vital role as alternative pollinators, and are suggested to be the
   most important pollinators after bees and bumblebees. Unless the flower
   hoverflies are feeding from is large, they do not readily share the
   space with other insects, but instead opt to leave if another insect
   approaches. We used high-speed videography followed by 3D reconstruction
   of flight trajectories to quantify how female Eristalis hoverflies
   respond to approaching bees, wasps and two different hoverfly species.
   We found that, in 94\% of the interactions, the occupant female left the
   flower when approached by another insect. We found that compared with
   spontaneous take-offs, the occupant hoverfly's escape response was
   performed at similar to 3 times higher speed (spontaneous take-off at
   0.20.05 m s(-1) compared with 0.55 +/- 0.08 m s(-1) when approached by
   another Eristalis). The hoverflies tended to take off upward and
   forward, while taking the incomer's approach angle into account.
   Intriguingly, we found that, when approached by wasps, the occupant
   Eristalis took off at a higher speed and when the wasp was further away.
   This suggests that feeding hoverflies may be able to distinguish these
   predators, demanding impressive visual capabilities. Our results,
   including quantification of the visual information available before
   occupant take-off, provide important insight into how freely behaving
   hoverflies perform escape responses from competitors and predators (e.g.
   wasps) in the wild.},

Abstract = {All vertebrate embryos are exposed to maternally derived steroids during
   development. In placental vertebrates, metabolism of maternal steroids
   by the placenta modulates embryonic exposure, but how exposure is
   regulated in oviparous vertebrates is less clear. Recent work in
   oviparous vertebrates has demonstrated that steroids are not static
   molecules, as they can be converted to more polar steroid sulfates by
   sulfotransferase enzymes. Importantly, these steroid sulfates can be
   converted back to the parent compound by the enzyme steroid sulfatase
   (STS). We investigated when and where STS was present during embryonic
   development in the red-eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta. We report
   that STS is present during all stages of development and in all tissues
   we examined. We conclude that STS activity may be particularly important
   for regulating maternal steroid exposure in oviparous vertebrates.},

Title = {Social dominance and reproductive differentiation mediated by
   dopaminergic signaling in a queenless ant},

Abstract = {In social Hymenoptera with no morphological caste, a dominant female
   becomes an egg layer, whereas subordinates become sterile helpers. The
   physiological mechanism that links dominance rank and fecundity is an
   essential part of the emergence of sterile females, which reflects the
   primitive phase of eusociality. Recent studies suggest that brain
   biogenic amines are correlated with the ranks in dominance hierarchy.
   However, the actual causality between aminergic systems and phenotype
   (i.e. fecundity and aggressiveness) is largely unknown due to the
   pleiotropic functions of amines (e.g. age-dependent polyethism) and the
   scarcity of manipulation experiments. To clarify the causality among
   dominance ranks, amine levels and phenotypes, we examined the dynamics
   of the aminergic system during the ontogeny of dominance hierarchy in
   the queenless ant Diacamma sp., which undergoes rapid physiological
   differentiation based on dominance interactions. Brain dopamine levels
   differed between dominants and subordinates at day 7 after eclosion,
   although they did not differ at day 1, reflecting fecundity but not
   aggressiveness. Topical applications of dopamine to the subordinate
   workers induced oocyte growth but did not induce aggressiveness,
   suggesting the gonadotropic effect of dopamine. Additionally, dopamine
   receptor transcripts (dopr1 and dopr2) were elevated in the gaster fat
   body of dominant females, suggesting that the fat body is a potential
   target of neurohormonal dopamine. Based on this evidence, we suggest
   that brain dopamine levels are elevated in dominants as a result of
   hierarchy formation, and differences in dopamine levels cause the
   reproductive differentiation, probably via stimulation of the fat body.},

Abstract = {A central principle of life-history theory is that parents trade
   investment in reproduction against that in body maintenance. One
   physiological cost thought to be important as a modulator of such
   trade-off is oxidative stress. Experimental support for this hypothesis
   has, however, proved to be contradictory. In this study, we manipulated
   the nestling rearing effort of captive canaries (Serinus canaria) soon
   after the hatching of their nestlings using a brood-size manipulation to
   test whether an increase in nestling rearing effort translates into an
   increase in oxidative damage, an increase in ceruloplasmin (which is
   upregulated in response to oxidative damage) and a decrease in thiol
   antioxidants. We also compared the blood oxidative stress level of
   reproducing birds with that of non-reproducing birds, a crucial aspect
   that most studies have invariably failed to include in tests of the
   oxidative cost of reproduction. Compared with non-breeding canaries and
   pre-manipulation values, plasma oxidative damage (reactive oxygen
   metabolites and protein carbonyls) decreased in breeding canaries
   irrespective of sex and brood size. In contrast, oxidative damage did
   not change in non-breeding birds over the experiment. Ceruloplasmin
   activity in plasma and both non-protein and protein thiols in red blood
   cells did not change throughout the experiment in both treatment groups.
   Our results suggest that reproduction may result in decreased rather
   than increased blood oxidative stress. Our results may explain some of
   the inconsistencies that have so far been reported in experimental tests
   of the oxidative cost of reproduction hypothesis.},

Title = {High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during

Abstract = {Increased oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological
   cost of reproduction. However, previous studies reported ambiguous
   results, with some even showing a reduction of oxidative damage during
   reproduction. We tested whether the link between reproduction and OS is
   mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to
   affect both the rate of radical oxygen species production and
   antioxidative capacity. We studied the effect of reproduction on OS in
   females of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low
   (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to parental
   investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR females showed higher oxidative damage
   to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ
   tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum)
   than H-BMR females. Reproduction did not affect oxidative damage to
   lipids in either line; however, it reduced damage to DNA in L-BMR
   females. Reproduction increased catalase activity in liver
   (significantly stronger in L-BMR females) and decreased it in kidneys.
   We conclude that the effect of reproduction on OS depends on the initial
   variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers
   of OS.},

Abstract = {Increased brain size, relative to body mass, is a primary characteristic
   distinguishing the mammalian lineage. This greater encephalization has
   come with increased behavioral complexity and, accordingly, it has been
   suggested that selection on behavioral traits has been a significant
   factor leading to the evolution of larger whole-brain mass. In addition,
   brains may evolve in a mosaic fashion, with functional components having
   some freedom to evolve independently from other components, irrespective
   of, or in addition to, changes in size of the whole brain. We tested
   whether long-term selective breeding for high voluntary wheel running in
   laboratory house mice results in changes in brain size, and whether
   those changes have occurred in a concerted or mosaic fashion. We
   measured wet and dry brain mass via dissections and brain volume with ex
   vivo magnetic resonance imaging of brains that distinguished the
   caudate-putamen, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebellum and forebrain.
   Adjusting for body mass as a covariate, mice from the four replicate
   high-runner (HR) lines had statistically larger non-cerebellar wet and
   dry brain masses than those from four non-selected control lines, with
   no differences in cerebellum wet or dry mass or volume. Moreover, the
   midbrain volume in HR mice was similar to 13\% larger (P<0.05), while
   volumes of the caudate-putamen, hippocampus, cerebellum and forebrain
   did not differ statistically between HR and control lines. We
   hypothesize that the enlarged midbrain of HR mice is related to altered
   neurophysiological function in their dopaminergic system. To our
   knowledge, this is the first example in which selection for a particular
   mammalian behavior has been shown to result in a change in size of a
   specific brain region.},

Title = {Relative importance of intensity and spectrum of artificial light at
   night in disrupting behavior of a nocturnal rodent},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The influence of light spectral properties on circadian rhythms is of
   substantial interest to laboratory-based investigation of the circadian
   system and to field-based understanding of the effects of artificial
   light at night. The trade-offs between intensity and spectrum regarding
   masking behaviors are largely unknown, even for well-studied organisms.
   We used a custom LED illumination system to document the response of
   wild-type house mice (Mus musculus) to 1-h nocturnal exposure of all
   combinations of four intensity levels (0.01, 0.5, 5 and 50 lx) and three
   correlated color temperatures (CCT; 1750, 1950 and 3000 K). Higher
   intensities of light (50 lx) suppressed cage activity substantially, and
   consistently more for the higher CCT light (91\% for 3000 K, 53\% for
   1750 K). At the lowest intensity (0.01 lx), mean activity was increased,
   with the greatest increases for the lowest CCT (12.3\% increase at 1750
   K, 3\% increase at 3000 K). Multiple linear regression confirmed the
   influence of both CCT and intensity on changes in activity, with the
   scaled effect size of intensity 3.6 times greater than that of CCT.
   Activity suppression was significantly lower for male than for female
   mice. Assessment of light-evoked cFos expression in the suprachiasmatic
   nucleus at 50 lx showed no significant difference between high and low
   CCT exposure. The significant differences by spectral composition
   illustrate a need to account for light spectrum in circadian studies of
   behavior, and confirm that spectral controls can mitigate some, but
   certainly not all, of the effects of light pollution on species in the
   wild.},

Title = {Animal navigation: a noisy magnetic sense?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {223},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Diverse organisms use Earth's magnetic field as a cue in orientation and
   navigation. Nevertheless, eliciting magnetic orientation responses
   reliably, either in laboratory or natural settings, is often difficult.
   Many species appear to preferentially exploit non-magnetic cues if they
   are available, suggesting that the magnetic sense often serves as a
   redundant or backup' source of information. This raises an interesting
   paradox: Earth's magnetic field appears to be more pervasive and
   reliable than almost any other navigational cue. Why then do animals not
   rely almost exclusively on the geomagnetic field, while ignoring or
   downplaying other cues? Here, we explore a possible explanation: that
   the magnetic sense of animals is `noisy', in that the magnetic signal is
   small relative to thermal and receptor noise. Magnetic receptors are
   thus unable to instantaneously acquire magnetic information that is
   highly precise or accurate. We speculate that extensive time-averaging
   and/or other higher-order neural processing of magnetic information is
   required, rendering the magnetic sense inefficient relative to
   alternative cues that can be detected faster and with less effort. This
   interpretation is consistent with experimental results suggesting a long
   time course for magnetic compass and map responses in some animals.
   Despite possible limitations, magnetoreception may be maintained by
   natural selection because the geomagnetic field is sometimes the only
   source of directional and/or positional information available.},

Title = {Hif-1α paralogs play a role in the hypoxic ventilatory response of
   larval and adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)},

Abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif) 1 alpha, an extensively studied
   transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of many biological
   processes in hypoxia including the hypoxic ventilatory response. In
   zebrafish, there are two paralogs of Hif-1 alpha (Hif-1A and Hif-1B),
   but little is known about the specific roles or potential
   sub-functionalization of the paralogs in response to hypoxia. Using
   knockout lines of Hif-1 alpha paralogs, we examined their involvement in
   the hypoxic ventilatory response, measured as ventilation frequency
   (f(V)) in larval and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). In wild-type
   zebrafish, f(V )increased across developmental time (4, 7, 10 and 15
   days post-fertilization, dpf) in response to hypoxia (55 mmHg). In
   contrast, the Hif-1B knockout fish did not exhibit an increase in
   hypoxic f(V) at 4 dpf. Similar to wild-type, as larvae of all knockout
   lines developed, the magnitude of f(V) increased but to a lesser degree
   than in the wild-type larvae, until 15 dpf at which point there was no
   difference among the genotypes. In adult zebrafish, only in Hif-1B
   knockout fish was there an attenuation in f(V) during sustained exposure
   to 30 mmHg for 1 h but there was no effect when fish were exposed for a
   shorter duration to progressive hypoxia. The mechanism of action of
   Hif-1 alpha, in part, may be through its downstream target, nitric oxide
   synthase, and its product, nitric oxide. Overall, the effect of each
   Hif-1 alpha paralog on the hypoxic ventilatory response of zebrafish
   varies over development and is dependent on the type of hypoxic stress.},

Title = {Patterns of fatty acid usage in two nocturnal insectivores: the

Abstract = {Dietary fatty acids (FAs) have been demonstrated to be differentially
   stored or used as a metabolic fuel, depending on carbon chain length or
   saturation level. However, intestinal absorption also differs among FAs,
   potentially biasing conclusions on functional differences and their
   subsequent implications. We tested dietary FA usage in a nocturnal
   insectivorous reptile and a nocturnal insectivorous mammal of similar
   size: the gecko Hemidactylus turcicus and the shrew Suncus etruscus. We
   compared the relative presence of 13C isotopes in breath and feces
   following ingestion of three isotopically enriched fatty acids: linoleic
   acid (a polyunsaturated FA), oleic acid (monounsaturated) and palmitic
   acid (saturated). Both species oxidized linoleic and oleic acids at much
   higher levels than palmitic acid. Egestion of palmitic acid in feces was
   much higher than that of linoleic and oleic acids. The major difference
   between geckos and shrews was that the latter digested fatty acids much
   faster, which was best explained by the difference in the metabolic
   rates of the species. Circadian differences were evident for gecko
   metabolic and FA oxidation rates, peaking at night; for shrews, peak
   oxidation was achieved faster at night but rates did not differ. Our
   study is among the first to integrate oxidation and absorption patterns,
   as well as metabolic rates and their rhythms, providing important
   insights into the utilization of different dietary FAs in different
   species.},

Title = {Metabolic consequences of sex reversal in two lizard species: a test of

Abstract = {Vertebrate sex is typically determined genetically, but in many
   ectotherms sex can be determined by genes (genetic sex determination,
   TSD), or interactions between genes and temperature during development.
   TSD may involve GSD systems with either male or female heterogamety
   (XX/XY or ZZ/ZW) where temperature overrides chromosomal sex
   determination to cause a mismatch between genetic sex and phenotypic sex
   (sex reversal). In these temperature-sensitive lineages, phylogenetic
   investigations point to recurrent evolutionary shifts between genotypic
   and temperature-dependent sex determination. These evolutionary
   transitions in sex determination can occur rapidly if selection favours
   the reversed sex over the concordant phenotypic sex. To investigate the
   consequences of sex reversal on offspring phenotypes, we measured two
   energy-driven traits (metabolism and growth) and 6 month survival in two
   species of reptile with different patterns of temperature-induced sex
   reversal. females (female XX) develop male phenotypes (maleSR XX), while
   female sex reversal occurs in Pogona vitticeps when chromosomal males
   (male ZZ) develop female phenotypes (femaleSR ZZ). We show metabolism in
   maleSR XX was like that of male XY; that is, reflective of phenotypic
   sex and lower than genotypic sex. In contrast, for Pogona vitticeps,
   femaleSR ZZ metabolism was intermediate between male ZZ and female ZW
   metabolic rate. For both species, our data indicate that differences in
   metabolism become more apparent as individuals become larger. Our
   findings provide some evidence for an energetic advantage from sex
   reversal in both species but do not exclude energetic processes as a
   constraint on the distribution of sex reversal in nature.},

Abstract = {Visual animal communication, whether to the same or to other species, is
   largely conducted through dynamic and colourful signals. For a signal to
   be effective, the signaller must capture and retain the attention of the
   receiver. Signal efficacy is also dependent on the sensory limitations
   of the receiver. However, most signalling studies consider movement and
   colour separately, resulting in a partial understanding of the signal in
   question. We explored the structure and function of predator-prey
   signalling in the jumping spider-tephritid fly system, where the prey
   performs a wing waving display that deters an attack from the predator.
   Using a custom-built spider retinal tracker combined with visual
   modelling, as well as behavioural assays, we studied the effect of fly
   wing movement and colour on the jumping spider's visual system. We show
   that jumping spiders track their prey less effectively during wing
   display and this can be attributed to a series of fluctuations in
   chromatic and achromatic contrasts arising from the wing movements.
   These results suggest that displaying flies deter spider attacks by
   manipulating the movement biases of the spider's visual system. Our
   results emphasise the importance of receiver attention on the evolution
   of interspecific communication.},

Title = {Enhanced resistance to Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>-induced mitochondrial
   permeability transition in the long-lived red-footed tortoise
   <i>Chelonoidis carbonaria</i>},

Abstract = {The interaction between supraphysiological cytosolic Ca2+ levels and
   mitochondrial redox imbalance mediates the mitochondrial permeability
   transition (MPT). The MPT is involved in cell death, diseases and aging.
   This study compared the liver mitochondrial Ca2+ retention capacity and
   oxygen consumption in the long-lived red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis
   carbonada) with those in the rat as a reference standard. Mitochondrial
   Ca2+ retention capacity, a quantitative measure of MPT sensitivity, was
   remarkably higher in tortoises than in rats. This difference was
   minimized in the presence of the MPT inhibitors ADP and cyclosporine A.
   However, the Ca2+ retention capacities of tortoise and rat liver
   mitochondria were similar when both MPT inhibitors were present
   simultaneously. NADH-linked phosphorylating respiration rates of
   tortoise liver mitochondria represented only 30\% of the maximal
   electron transport system capacity, indicating a limitation imposed by
   the phosphorylation system. These results suggested underlying
   differences in putative MPT structural components {[}e.g. ATP synthase,
   adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) and cyclophilin D] between
   tortoises and rats. Indeed, in tortoise mitochondria, titrations of
   inhibitors of the oxidative phosphorylation components revealed a higher
   limitation of ANT. Furthermore, cyclophilin D activity was approximately
   70\% lower in tortoises than in rats. Investigation of critical
   properties of mitochondrial redox control that affect MPT demonstrated
   that tortoise and rat liver mitochondria exhibited similar rates of H2O2
   release and glutathione redox status. Overall, our findings suggest that
   constraints imposed by ANT and cyclophilin D, putative components or
   regulators of the MPT pore, are associated with the enhanced resistance
   to Ca2+-induced MPT in tortoises.},

Abstract = {`Omics' methods, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics or
   metabolomics, yield simultaneous measurements of many related molecules
   in a sample. These approaches have opened new opportunities to generate
   and test hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying biochemical and
   physiological phenotypes. In this Commentary, we discuss general
   approaches and considerations for successfully integrating omics into
   comparative physiology. The choice of omics approach will be guided by
   the availability of existing resources and the time scale of the process
   being studied. We discuss the use of whole-organism extracts (common in
   omics experiments on small invertebrates) because such an approach may
   mask underlying physiological mechanisms, and we consider the advantages
   and disadvantages of pooling samples within biological replicates. These
   methods can bring analytical challenges, so we describe the most easily
   analyzed omics experimental designs. We address the propensity of omics
   studies to digress into `fishing expeditions' and show how omics can be
   used within the hypothetico-deductive framework. With this Commentary,
   we hope to provide a roadmap that will help newcomers approach omics in
   comparative physiology while avoiding some of the potential pitfalls,
   which include ambiguous experiments, long lists of candidate molecules
   and vague conclusions.},

Title = {Effects of membrane fatty acid composition on cellular metabolism and
   oxidative stress in dermal fibroblasts from small and large breed dogs},

Abstract = {There is ample evidence that cell membrane architecture contributes to
   metabolism and aging in animals: however, the aspects of this
   architecture that determine the rate of metabolism and longevity are
   still being debated. The `membrane pacemaker' hypothesis of metabolism
   and of aging, respectively, suggest that increased lipid unsaturation
   and large amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in cell
   membranes increase the cellular metabolic rate as well as the
   vulnerability of the cell to oxidative damage, thus increasing
   organismal metabolic rate and decreasing longevity. Here, we tested
   these hypotheses by experimentally altering the membrane fatty acid
   composition of fibroblast cells derived from small and large breed dogs
   by incubating them in a medium enriched in the monounsaturated fatty
   acid (MUFA) oleic acid (OA, 18:1) to decrease the total saturation. We
   then measured cellular metabolic parameters and correlated these
   parameters with membrane fatty acid composition and oxidative stress. We
   found that cells from small dogs and OA-incubated cells had lower
   maximal oxygen consumption and basal oxygen consumption rates,
   respectively, which are traits associated with longer lifespans.
   Furthermore, although we did not find differences in oxidative stress,
   cells from small dogs and OA-treated cells exhibited reduced ATP
   coupling efficiency, suggesting that these cells are less prone to
   producing reactive oxygen species. Membrane fatty acid composition did
   not differ between cells from large and small dogs, but cells incubated
   with OA had more monounsaturated fatty acids and a higher number of
   double bonds overall despite a decrease in PUFAs. Our results suggest
   that increasing the monounsaturation of dog cell membranes may alter
   some metabolic parameters linked to increases in longevity.},

Title = {Functional morphology of endurance swimming performance and gait
   transition strategies in balistoid fishes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {222},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Triggerfishes and filefishes (Balistoidea) use balistiform locomotion to
   power steady swimming with their dorsal and anal fins, and transition to
   a gait dominated by body and caudal fin (BCF) kinematics at high speeds.
   Fin and body shapes are predicted to be strong determinants of swimming
   performance and gait transitions. The goal of this study was to combine
   morphometrics and critical swimming tests to explore the relationships
   between fin and body shapes and swimming performance in a phylogenetic
   context in order to understand the evolution of balistiform swimming.
   Among 13 species of balistoid fishes, those with high aspect ratio fins
   tended to achieve higher critical swimming speeds than fishes with low
   aspect ratio fins. Species with long, large median fins and wide caudal
   peduncles used the balistiform gait alone for a larger percentage of
   their total critical swimming speed than fishes with short, small median
   fins and narrow caudal peduncles. Although analyses revealed overall
   positive relationships between median fin aspect ratios and gait
   transition speeds, fishes on both ends of the aspect ratio spectrum
   achieved higher swimming speeds using the balistiform gait alone than
   fishes with median fins of intermediate aspect ratios. Each species is
   specialized for taking advantage of one gait, with balistiform
   specialists possessing long, large median fins capable of the large
   power requirements of high-speed swimming using the median fins alone,
   while BCF specialists possess short, small median fins, ill-suited for
   powering high-speed balistiform locomotion, but narrow caudal peduncles
   capable of efficient caudal fin oscillations to power high-speed
   locomotion.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Little auks (Alle alle) are one of the most numerous seabird species in
   the world and feed primarily on copepods in arctic waters. Their high
   daily energy requirements leave them vulnerable to current changes in
   the arctic plankton community, where a smaller, less-profitable copepod
   species (Calanus finmarchicus) becomes increasingly abundant. Little
   auks have been estimated to require similar to 60,000 copepods per day,
   necessitating prey capture rates of similar to 6 copepods per second
   underwater. To achieve such performance, it has been suggested that
   little auks capture their prey by (non-visual) filter feeding. We tested
   this hypothesis by exposing little auks to varying copepod densities
   within a shallow experimental pool and filming their prey capture
   behaviour. At none of the copepod densities tested did birds filter
   feed. Instead, all birds captured copepods by what we identified as
   visually guided suction feeding, achieved through an extension of their
   sub-lingual pouch. Suction feeding is very common in fish and marine
   mammals, but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
   it has been specifically identified in a seabird species. While
   presumably less efficient than filter feeding, this behaviour may allow
   little auks to foster higher resilience when facing the consequences of
   arctic climate change.},

Title = {Phenotypic plasticity of <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> wing to developmental
   temperature: implications for flight},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {221},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity has been proposed as a mechanism that facilitates
   the success of biological invasions. In order to test the hypothesis of
   an adaptive role for plasticity in invasions, particular attention
   should be paid to the relationship between the focal plastic trait, the
   environmental stimulus and the functional importance of the trait. The
   Drosophila wing is particularly amenable to experimental studies of
   phenotypic plasticity. Wing morphology is known for its plastic
   variation under different experimental temperatures, but this plasticity
   has rarely been investigated in a functional context of flight. Here, we
   investigate the effect of temperature on wing morphology and flight in
   the invasive pest species Drosophila suzukii. Although the rapid
   invasion of both Europe and North America was most likely facilitated by
   human activities, D. suzukii is also expected to disperse actively. By
   quantifying wing morphology and individual flight trajectories of flies
   raised under different temperatures, we tested whether (1) invasive
   populations of D. suzukii show higher phenotypic plasticity than their
   native counterparts, and (2) wing plasticity affects flight parameters.
   Developmental temperature was found to affect both wing morphology and
   flight parameters (in particular speed and acceleration), leaving open
   the possibility of an adaptive value for wing plasticity. Our results
   show no difference in phenotypic plasticity between invasive and native
   populations, rejecting a role for wing plasticity in the invasion
   success.},

Abstract = {The use of sensory information to control behavior usually involves the
   integration of sensory input from different modalities. This integration
   is affected by behavioral states and experience, and it is also
   sensitive to the spatiotemporal patterns of stimulation and other
   general contextual cues. Following the finding that hawkmoths can use
   relative humidity (RH) as a proxy for nectar content during close-range
   foraging, we evaluate here whether RH could be used during locomotive
   flight under two simulated contexts in a wind tunnel: (1) dispersion and
   (2) search phase of the foraging behavior. Flying moths showed a bias
   towards air with a higher RH in a context devoid of foraging stimuli,
   but the addition of visual and olfactory floral stimuli elicited
   foraging responses that overrode the behavioral effects of RH. We
   discuss the results in relation to the putative adaptive value of the
   context-dependent use of sensory information.},

Abstract = {To work out which microvascular remodeling processes occur in murine
   skeletal muscle during endurance exercise, we subjected C57BL/6 mice to
   voluntary running wheel training for 1 week (1 wk-t) or 6 weeks (6
   wks-t). By means of morphometry, the capillarity as well as the
   compartmental and sub-compartmental structure of the capillaries were
   quantitatively described at the light microscopy level and at the
   electron microscopy level, respectively, in the plantaris (PLNT) muscle
   of the exercising mice in comparison to untrained littermates. In the
   early phase of the training (1 wk-t), angiogenesis {[}32\% higher
   capillary/fiber (C/F) ratio; P<0.05] in PLNT muscle was accompanied by a
   tendency for capillary lumen enlargement (30\%; P=0.06) and a reduction
   of the pericapillary basement membrane thickness {[}(CBMT) 12.7\%;
   P=0.09] as well as a 21\% shortening of intraluminal protrusion length
   (P<0.05), all compared with controls. After long-term training (6
   wks-t), when the mice reached a steady state in running activity,
   additional angiogenesis (C/F ratio: 76\%; P<0.05) and a 16.3\% increase
   in capillary tortuosity (P<0.05) were established, accompanied by
   reversal of the lumen expansion (23\%; P>0.05), further reduction of the
   CBMT (16.5\%; P<0.05) and additional shortening of the intraluminal
   protrusion length (23\%; P<0.05), all compared with controls. Other
   structural indicators, such as capillary profile sizes, profile area
   densities, perimeters of the capillary compartments and concentrations
   of endothelium-pericyte peg-socket junctions, were not significantly
   different between the mouse groups. Besides angiogenesis, increase of
   capillary tortuosity and reduction of CBMT represent the most striking
   microvascular remodeling processes in skeletal muscle of mice that
   undergo running wheel training.},

Abstract = {Oxidative stress is the result of random cellular damage caused by
   reactive oxygen species that leads to cell death, ageing or illness.
   Most physiological processes can result in oxidative stress, which in
   turn has been identified as a major cause of infertility. In promiscuous
   species, the fertilizing ability of the ejaculate partly determines the
   male reproductive success. When dominance determines access to fertile
   females, theory predicts that lower ranking males should increase
   resource investment into enhancing ejaculate quality. We hypothesized
   that subordinate males should thus prioritize antioxidant protection of
   their ejaculates to protect them from oxidative stress. We put this
   hypothesis to the test by chronically dosing wild house sparrows with
   diquat (similar to 1 mg kg(-1)), a herbicide that increases pro-oxidant
   generation. We found that, although they increased their antioxidant
   levels in the ejaculate, diquat-treated males produced sperm with
   reduced velocity. Importantly, and contrary to our hypothesis, males at
   the bottom of the hierarchy suffered the largest reduction in sperm
   velocity. We suggest that resource access hinders individuals' ability
   to cope with environmental hazards. Our results point at oxidative
   stress as a likely physiological mechanism mediating ejaculate quality,
   while individual ability to access resources may play a role in
   constraining the extent to which such resources can be allocated into
   the ejaculate.},

   in reproduction. Likewise, superorganisms, such as honey bee colonies,
   first invest in survival and growth, and later commit resources to
   reproduction once the number of workers in the colony surpasses a
   reproductive threshold. The first form of reproductive investment for a
   honey bee colony is the building of beeswax comb made of special large
   cells used for rearing males (drones). How do the workers sense that
   their colony is large enough to start building this `drone comb'? To
   address this question, we experimentally increased three possible cues
   of colony size - worker density, volatile pheromone concentration and
   nest temperature - and looked for effects on the bees' comb
   construction. Only the colonies that experienced increased worker
   density were stimulated to build a higher proportion of drone comb. We
   then monitored and quantified potential cues in small and large
   colonies, to determine which cues change with colony size. We found that
   workers in large colonies, relative to small ones, have increased
   contact rates, spend more time active and experience less variable
   worker density. Whereas unicellular and multicellular organisms use
   mainly chemical cues to sense their sizes, our results suggest that at
   least one superorganism, a honey bee colony, uses physical cues to sense
   its size and thus its developmental state.},

Abstract = {Crocodilians are among the most vocal non-avian reptiles. Adults of both
   sexes produce loud vocalizations known as `bellows' year round, with the
   highest rate during the mating season. Although the specific function of
   these vocalizations remains unclear, they may advertise the caller's
   body size, because relative size differences strongly affect courtship
   and territorial behaviour in crocodilians. In mammals and birds, a
   common mechanism for producing honest acoustic signals of body size is
   via formant frequencies (vocal tract resonances). To our knowledge,
   formants have to date never been documented in any non-avian reptile,
   and formants do not seem to play a role in the vocalizations of anurans.
   We tested for formants in crocodilian vocalizations by using playbacks
   to induce a female Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis) to bellow in
   an airtight chamber. During vocalizations, the animal inhaled either
   normal air or a helium/oxygen mixture (heliox) in which the velocity of
   sound is increased. Although heliox allows normal respiration, it alters
   the formant distribution of the sound spectrum. An acoustic analysis of
   the calls showed that the source signal components remained constant
   under both conditions, but an upward shift of high-energy frequency
   bands was observed in heliox. We conclude that these frequency bands
   represent formants. We suggest that crocodilian vocalizations could thus
   provide an acoustic indication of body size via formants. Because birds
   and crocodilians share a common ancestor with all dinosaurs, a better
   understanding of their vocal production systems may also provide insight
   into the communication of extinct Archosaurians.},

Title = {Physiological adaptations to reproduction. II. Mitochondrial adjustments

Abstract = {Reproduction imposes significant costs and is characterized by an
   increased energy demand. As a consequence, individuals adjust their
   cellular structure and function in response to this physiological
   constraint. Because mitochondria are central to energy production,
   changes in their functional properties are likely to occur during
   reproduction. Such changes could cause adjustments in reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) production and consequently in oxidative stress levels. In
   this study, we investigated several mechanisms involved in energy
   production, including mitochondrial respiration at different steps of
   the electron transport system (ETS) and related the results to citrate
   synthase activity in the liver of non-reproductive and reproductive (two
   and eight pups) female house mice at peak lactation. Whereas we did not
   find differences between females having different litter sizes, liver
   mitochondria of reproductive females showed lower ETS activity and an
   increase in mitochondrial density when compared with the
   non-reproductive females. Although it is possible that these changes
   were due to combined processes involved in reproduction and not to the
   relative investment in lactation, we propose that the mitochondrial
   adjustment in liver might help to spare substrates and therefore energy
   for milk production in the mammary gland. Moreover, our results suggest
   that these changes lead to an increase in ROS production that
   subsequently upregulates antioxidant defence activity and decreases
   oxidative stress.},

Title = {The early life of king penguins: ontogeny of dive capacity and foraging
   behaviour in an expert diver},

Abstract = {The period of emancipation in seabirds, when juveniles change from a
   terrestrial existence to a life at sea, is associated with many
   challenges. Apart from finding favourable foraging sites, they have to
   develop effective prey search patterns and physiological capacities that
   enable them to capture sufficient prey to meet their energetic needs.
   Animals that dive to forage, such as king penguins (Aptenodytes
   patagonicus), need to acquire an adequate breathhold capacity, allowing
   them to locate and capture prey at depth. To investigate the ontogeny of
   their dive capacity and foraging performance, we implanted juvenile king
   penguins before their first departure to sea and also adult breeders
   with a data-logger recording pressure and temperature. We found that
   juvenile king penguins possess a remarkable dive capacity when leaving
   their natal colony, enabling them to conduct dives in excess of 100 m
   within their first week at sea. Despite this, juvenile dive/foraging
   performance, investigated in relation to dive depth, remained below the
   adult level throughout their first year at sea, probably reflecting
   physiological limitations as a result of incomplete maturation. A
   significantly shallower foraging depth of juveniles, particularly during
   their first 5 months at sea, could also indicate differences in foraging
   strategy and targeted prey. The initially greater wiggle rate suggests
   that juveniles fed opportunistically and also targeted different prey
   from adults and/or that many of the wiggles of juveniles reflect
   unsuccessful prey-capture attempts, indicating a lower foraging
   proficiency. After 5 months, this difference disappeared, suggesting
   sufficient physical maturation and improvement of juvenile foraging
   skills.},

Title = {Establishment of correctly focused eyes may not require visual input in
   arthropods},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {223},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {For proper function, vertebrate and invertebrate visual systems must be
   able to achieve and maintain emmetropia, a state where distant objects
   are in focus on the retina. In vertebrates, this is accomplished through
   a combination of genetic control during early development and
   homeostatic visual input that fine-tunes the optics of the eye. While
   emmetropization has long been researched in vertebrates, it is largely
   unknown how emmetropia is established in arthropods. We used a
   micro-ophthalmoscope to directly measure how the lens projects images
   onto the retina in the eyes of small, live arthropods, allowing us to
   compare the refractive states of light-reared and dark-reared
   arthropods. First, we measured the image-forming larval eyes of diving
   beetles (Thermonectus marmoratus), which are known to grow rapidly and
   dramatically between larval instars. Then, we measured the image-forming
   principal anterior-median eyes of jumping spiders (Phidippus audax)
   after emergence from their egg cases. Finally, we measured individual
   ommatidia in the compound eyes of flesh flies (Sarcophaga bullata) that
   had developed and emerged under either light or dark conditions.
   Surprisingly, and in sharp contrast to vertebrates, our data for this
   diverse set of arthropods suggest that visual input is inconsequential
   in regard to achieving well-focused eyes. Although it remains unclear
   whether visual input that is received after the initial development
   further improves focusing, these results suggest that at least the
   initial coordination between the lens refractive power and eye size in
   arthropods may be more strongly predetermined by developmental factors
   than is typically the case in vertebrates.},

Abstract = {The ejection fraction of the trabeculated cardiac ventricle of reptiles
   has not previously been measured. Here, we used the gold standard
   clinical methodology - electrocardiogram-gated flow magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) - to validate stroke volume measurements and end diastolic
   ventricular blood volume. This produced an estimate of ejection fraction
   in our study species, the red footed tortoise Chelonoidis carbonarius
   (n=5), under isoflurane anaesthesia of 88 +/- 11\%. After reduction of
   the prevailing right-to-left intraventricular shunt through the action
   of atropine, the ejection fraction was 96 +/- 6\%. This methodology
   opens new avenues for studying the complex hearts of ectotherms, and
   validating hypotheses on the function of a more highly trabeculated
   heart than that of endotherms, which have lower ejection fractions.},

Abstract = {We explore a recent, innovative variation of closed-system respirometry
   for terrestrial organisms, whereby oxygen partial pressure (PO2) is
   repeatedly measured fluorometrically in a constant-volume chamber over
   multiple time points. We outline a protocol that aligns this technology
   with the broader literature on aerial respirometry, including the
   calculations required to accurately convert O-2 depletion to metabolic
   rate (MR). We identify a series of assumptions, and sources of error
   associated with this technique, including thresholds where O-2 depletion
   becomes limiting, that impart errors to the calculation and
   interpretation of MR. Using these adjusted calculations, we found that
   the resting MR of five species of angiosperm seeds ranged from 0.011 to
   0.640 ml g(-1) h(-1), consistent with published seed MR values. This
   innovative methodology greatly expands the lower size limit of
   terrestrial organisms that can be measured, and offers the potential for
   measuring MR changes over time as a result of physiological processes of
   the organism.},

Abstract = {Nematode-insect interactions are ubiquitous, complex and constantly
   changing as the host and nematode coevolve. The entomophilic nematode
   Pristionchus pacificus is found on a myriad beetle species worldwide,
   although the molecular dynamics of this relationship are largely
   unknown. To better understand how host cues affect P. pacificus
   embryogenesis, we characterized the threshold of sensitivity to the
   pheromone (Z)-7-tetradecen-2-one (ZTDO) by determining the minimum
   exposure duration and developmental window that results in P. pacificus
   embryonic lethality. We found early-stage embryos exposed to volatile
   ZTDO for as few as 4 h all display terminal embryogenesis, characterized
   by punctuated development up to 48 h later, with abnormal morphology and
   limited cavity formation. To determine if the pheromone arrests
   pre-hatching development by suffocating or permeabilizing the eggshells,
   we raised embryos under anoxic conditions and also examined eggshell
   permeability using the lipophilic dye FM4-64. We found that asphyxiating
   the embryos arrested embryogenesis in a reversible manner but did not
   phenocopy the effects of ZTDO exposure, whereas the ZTDO-induced
   disruption of embryogenesis did correlate with increased eggshell
   permeability. The effects of ZTDO are also highly specific, as other
   lipid insect compounds do not produce any detectable embryocidal effect.
   The high specificity and unusual teratogenic effect of ZTDO may be
   important in mediating the host-nematode relationship by regulating P.
   pacificus development.},

Title = {Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to
   the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm},

Abstract = {Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between
   energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar
   motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm
   motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we
   performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for
   further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian
   sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence
   of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast,
   inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant
   decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding
   velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the
   presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or beta-hydroxybutyrate).
   The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent
   in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis
   inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These
   results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP
   buffering system, transferring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration
   at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the
   distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer
   high energy phosphoryis, we calculated intraflagellar concentration
   profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer
   simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of
   glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the
   flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy
   homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also
   through energy transfer.},

Title = {Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>)
   elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?},

Abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage
   fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the
   phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail
   (Coturnix chinensis) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were
   offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5\%
   neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of
   higher fibre contents of 16\% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine
   whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the
   fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy
   contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was `balanced'
   with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet.
   Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly
   heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared
   with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but
   energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier
   entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet
   was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier
   gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the
   unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their
   metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that
   the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting
   phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than
   simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular
   compensation to fibrous ingesta.},

Title = {The effects of caudal fin loss and regeneration on the swimming
   performance of three cyprinid fish species with different swimming
   capacities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In nature, the caudal fins of fish species are frequently lost to some
   extent by aggressive behaviour, predation and diseases. To test whether
   the swimming performance of fish with different swimming capacities
   would be differentially affected due to caudal fin loss and
   regeneration, we investigated the critical swimming speed (U-crit),
   swimming metabolic rate ((M) over dot(O2)), tail beat frequency (f(TB))
   and tail beat amplitude (A(TB)) after caudal fin loss and regeneration
   (20 days) in juveniles of three cyprinid fish species: the qingbo
   (Spinibarbus sinensis; strong swimmer), the common carp (Cyprinus
   carpio; intermediate swimmer) and the goldfish (Carassius auratus; poor
   swimmer). The Ucrit values of the caudal-fin-lost qingbo, common carp
   and goldfish were 49, 32 and 35\% significantly lower than those of the
   control groups, respectively. The maximum tail beat amplitude (A(TBmax))
   (all three fishes), the maximum tail beat frequency (f(TBmax)) (only the
   common carp and the goldfish) and/or the active metabolic rate ((M) over
   dot(O2active)) (only the common carp) of the caudal-fin-lost fish were
   significantly higher than those of the control groups. After 20 days of
   recovery, the caudal fins recovered to 41, 47 and 24\% of those of the
   control groups for the qingbo, the common carp and the goldfish,
   respectively. However, the U-crit values of the fin-regenerated qingbo,
   common carp and goldfish recovered to 86, 91 and 95\% of those of the
   control group, respectively. The caudal-fin-regenerated qingbo and
   common carp showed a significantly higher A(TBmax) and f(TBmax),
   respectively, compared with those of the control groups. The qingbo had
   a higher f(TBmax) but a lower A(TBmax) than the common carp and the
   goldfish, which suggested that a strong swimmer may maintain swimming
   speed primarily by maintaining a greater f(TBmax), for which the caudal
   fin plays a more important role during swimming, than a poor swimmer.
   The (M) over dot(O2active) of fish (common carp) with a redundant
   respiratory capacity could increase due to caudal fin loss to meet the
   increase in energy expenditure required by an increase in f(TBmax). In
   addition, the sustained swimming performance may not be the only
   selective pressure acting on caudal fin size in these three species, and
   the present caudal fin size may be a trade-off between sustain swimming
   performance and other factors (e.g. sexual selection, escape responses).},

Title = {The influence of plant odours on sexual readiness in an insectivorous
   songbird},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {226},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Many organisms rely on environmental cues to predict and anticipate the
   annual optimal timing of reproduction. In insectivorous birds,
   preparation for breeding often coincides with the time vegetation starts
   to develop in spring. Whether there is a direct relationship between the
   two, and through which mechanisms this link could come about, has rarely
   been investigated. Plants release herbivore-induced plant volatiles
   (HIPVs) when they are attacked by insects, and recent studies have shown
   that birds can detect and orient to those odours when searching for
   food. Whether those volatiles also stimulate sexual reproductive
   development and timing of reproduction remains to be discovered. We
   tested this hypothesis by monitoring gonadal growth in pairs of blue
   tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) exposed to air from caterpillar-infested oak
   trees or from a control, in spring. We found that while males and
   females grew their gonads over time, gonads grew at the same rate in
   both odour treatments. More exploratory (i.e. a proxy of personality)
   females did, however, have larger ovarian follicle sizes when exposed to
   the HIPVs than to the control air, which is consistent with earlier
   results showing that fast explorers have larger gonads in spring and are
   more sensitive to HIPVs. If HIPVs constitute powerful attractants in
   foraging birds, their influence on gonadal development prior to breeding
   appears to be relatively subtle and to only enhance reproductive
   readiness in some individuals. These results are nevertheless important
   as they set olfaction as a new player in the seasonal timing of
   reproduction in birds.},

Abstract = {High voltage electric shocks cause life threatening cardiac injuries
   such as sudden cardiac standstill or severe myocardial injury. Here, we
   analysed the physiology of the heart of the strongly electric catfish
   (Malapterurus beninensis) that stuns prey with high-voltage shocks but
   is immune to its own, as well as external, high-voltage shocks. Neither
   a detailed analysis of the electrocardiogram nor the structure of the
   heart indicated a specialized cardiac conduction system. Using a
   suitable perfusion system, we discovered that, despite its immunity in
   vivo, the explanted heart of electric catfish can readily be activated
   by external electrical currents and is equally sensitive to electric
   shock-induced arrhythmias as similar-sized goldfish hearts. The surprise
   thus is that the electric catfish has a vulnerable heart that requires
   to be protected by highly efficient but presently unknown means.},

Title = {Induced pluripotent stem cells as a tool for comparative physiology:
   lessons from the thirteen-lined ground squirrel},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Comparative physiologists are often interested in adaptive physiological
   phenomena found in unconventional model organisms; however, research on
   these species is frequently constrained by the limited availability of
   investigative tools. Here, we propose that induced pluripotent stem
   cells (iPSCs) from unconventional model organisms may retain certain
   species-specific features that can consequently be investigated in depth
   in vitro; we use hibernating mammals as an example. Many species
   (including ground squirrels, bats and bears) can enter a prolonged state
   of physiological dormancy known as hibernation to survive unfavorable
   seasonal conditions. Our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning
   the rapid transition and adaptation to a hypothermic, metabolically
   suppressed winter torpor state remains limited partially because of the
   lack of an easily accessible model. To address the fascinating
   unanswered questions underlying hibernation biology, we have developed a
   powerful model system: iPSCs from a hibernating species, the
   thirteen-lined ground squirrel (lctidomys tridecemlineatus). These stem
   cells can potentially be differentiated into any cell type, and can be
   used for the analysis of cell-autonomous mechanisms that facilitate
   adaptation to hibernation and for comparisons with non-hibernators.
   Furthermore, we can manipulate candidate molecular and cellular pathways
   underlying relevant physiological phenomena by pharmacological or
   RNA-ibased methods, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Moreover, iPSC
   strategies can be applied to other species (e.g. seals, naked mole rats,
   humming birds) for in vitro studies on adaptation to extreme
   physiological conditions. In this Commentary, we discuss factors to
   consider when attempting to generate iPSCs from unconventional model
   organisms, based on our experience with the thirteen-lined ground
   squirrel.},

Abstract = {Foraging to obtain food, either for self-maintenance or at presumably
   elevated rates to provide for offspring, is thought to be an
   energetically demanding activity but one that is essential for fitness
   (higher reproductive success and survival). Nevertheless, the
   physiological mechanisms that allow some individuals to support higher
   foraging performance, and the mechanisms underlying costs of high
   workload, remain poorly understood. We experimentally manipulated
   foraging behaviour in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) using the
   technique described by Koetsier and Verhulst (2011). Birds in the `high
   foraging effort' (HF) group had to obtain food either while
   flying/hovering or by making repeated hops or jumps from the ground up
   to the feeder, behaviour typical of the extremely energetically
   expensive foraging mode observed in many free-living small passerines.
   HF birds made significantly more trips to the feeder per 10 min, whereas
   control birds spent more time (perched) at the feeder. Despite this
   marked change in foraging behaviour, we documented few short- or
   long-term effects of `training' (3 days and 90 days of `training',
   respectively) and some of these effects were sex specific. There were no
   effects of treatment on basal metabolic rate, haematocrit, haemoglobin
   or plasma glycerol, triglyceride and glucose levels, and masses of
   kidney, crop, large intestine, small intestine, gizzard and liver. HF
   females had higher masses of flight muscle, leg muscle, heart and lung
   compared with controls. In contrast, HF males had lower heart mass than
   controls and there were no differences for other organs. When both sexes
   were pooled, there were no effects of treatment on body composition.
   Finally, birds in the HF treatment group had higher levels of reactive
   oxygen metabolites (dROMs) and, consequently, although treatment did not
   affect total anti-oxidant capacity, birds in the HF treatment group had
   higher oxidative stress.},

Abstract = {In the dense aquatic environment, the most adept swimmers are
   streamlined to reduce drag and increase the efficiency of locomotion.
   However, because they open their mouth to wide gape angles to deploy
   their filtering apparatus, ram filter feeders apparently switch between
   diametrically opposite swimming modes: highly efficient, streamlined
   `beat-glide' swimming, and ram filter feeding, which has been
   hypothesized to be a high-cost feeding mode because of presumed
   increased drag. Ram filter-feeding forage fish are thought to play an
   important role in the flux of nutrients and energy in upwelling
   ecosystems; however, the biomechanics and energetics of this feeding
   mechanism remain poorly understood. We quantified the kinematics of an
   iconic forage fish, the northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax, during ram
   filter feeding and non-feeding, mouth-closed beat-glide swimming.
   Although many kinematic parameters between the two swimming modes were
   similar, we found that swimming speeds and tailbeat frequencies were
   significantly lower during ram feeding. Rather than maintain speed with
   the school, a speed which closely matches theoretical optimum
   filter-feeding speeds was consistently observed. Beat-glide swimming was
   characterized by high variability in all kinematic parameters, but
   variance in kinematic parameters was much lower during ram filter
   feeding. Under this mode, body kinematics are substantially modified,
   and E. mordax swims more slowly and with decreased lateral movement
   along the entire body, but most noticeably in the anterior. Our results
   suggest that hydrodynamic effects that come with deployment of the
   filtering anatomy may limit behavioral options during foraging and
   result in slower swimming speeds during ram filtration.},

Abstract = {Remarkably, American black bears (Ursus americanus) are capable of
   varying their heart rates to coincidewith their breathing, creating
   pauses of 30 s or more, yet they do not appear to suffer from embolic
   events. We evaluated some features of the clotting cascade of black
   bears, providing novel insights into the underlying mechanisms they
   evoke for embolic protection during hibernation. We measured activated
   clotting time, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin
   time during early denning (December), late denning (March) and summer
   (August). Activated clotting time during early hibernation was similar
   to 3 times longer than that observed among non-hibernating animals.
   Clotting time was reduced later in hibernation, when bears were within
   similar to 1 month of emerging from dens. Prothrombin time was similar
   for each seasonal time point, whereas activated partial thromboplastin
   time was highest during early denning and decreased during late denning
   and summer. We also examined D-dimer concentration to assess whether the
   bears were likely to have experienced embolic events. None of the
   nonparturient bears exceeded a D-dimer concentration of 250 ng ml(-1)
   (considered the clinical threshold for embolism in mammals). Our
   findings suggest there is unique expression of the clotting cascade in
   American black bears during hibernation, in which extrinsic pathways are
   maintained but intrinsic pathways are suppressed. This was evaluated by
   a significant difference between the activated clotting time and
   activated partial thromboplastin time during the denning and non-denning
   periods. These changes are likely adaptive, to avoid clotting events
   during states of immobilization and/or periods of asystole. However, an
   intact extrinsic pathway allows for healing of external injuries and/or
   foreign body responses.},

Abstract = {The German cockroach (Blattella germanica) is an excellent model
   omnivore for studying the effect of foraging effort on nutrient
   balancing behavior and physiology, and its consequences for performance.
   We investigated the effect of foraging distance on individual German
   cockroaches by providing two foods differing in protein-to-carbohydrate
   ratio at opposite ends of long containers or adjacent to each other in
   short containers. Each food was nutritionally imbalanced, but the two
   foods were nutritionally complementary, allowing optimal foraging by
   selective feeding from both foods. We measured nutrient-specific
   consumption in fifth instar nymphs and newly eclosed females foraging at
   the two distances, hypothesizing that individuals foraging over longer
   distance would select more carbohydrate-biased diets to compensate for
   the energetic cost of locomotion. We then determined dry mass growth and
   lipid accumulation in the nymphs as well as mass gain and the length of
   basal oocytes in the adult females as an estimate of sexual maturation.
   Nymphs foraging over longer distance accumulated less lipid relative to
   total dry mass growth, but contrary to our predictions, their protein
   intake was higher and they accumulated more structural mass. In
   concordance, adult females foraging over longer distance gained more
   body mass and matured their oocytes faster. Our results show a positive
   effect of foraging distance on fitness-related parameters at two life
   stages, in both cases involving increased consumption of specific
   nutrients corresponding to requirements at the respective life stage.},

Title = {Mixed input to olfactory glomeruli from two subsets of ciliated sensory
   neurons does not impede relay neuron specificity in the crucian carp},

Abstract = {The consensus view of olfactory processing is that the axons of
   receptor-specific primary olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) converge to a
   small subset of glomeruli, thus preserving the odour identity before the
   olfactory information is processed in higher brain centres. In the
   present study, we show that two different subsets of ciliated OSNs with
   different odorant specificities converge to the same glomeruli. In order
   to stain different ciliated OSNs in the crucian carp Carassius carassius
   we used two different chemical odorants, a bile salt and a purported
   alarm substance, together with fluorescent dextrans. The dye is
   transported within the axons and stains glomeruli in the olfactory bulb.
   Interestingly, the axons from the ciliated OSNs co-converge to the same
   glomeruli. Despite intermingled innervation of glomeruli, axons and
   terminal fields from the two different subsets of ciliated OSNs remained
   mono-coloured. By 4-6 days after staining, the dye was transported
   trans-synaptically to separately stained axons of relay neurons. These
   findings demonstrate that specificity of the primary neurons is retained
   in the olfactory pathways despite mixed innervation of the olfactory
   glomeruli. The results are discussed in relation to the emerging
   concepts about non-mammalian glomeruli.},

Title = {Skinned fibres produce the same power and force as intact fibre bundles

Abstract = {Skinned fibres have advantages for comparing the muscle properties of
   different animal species because they can be prepared from a needle
   biopsy taken under field conditions. However, it is not clear how well
   the contractile properties of skinned fibres reflect the properties of
   the muscle fibres in vivo. Here, we compare the mechanical performance
   of intact fibre bundles and skinned fibres from muscle of the same
   animals. This is the first such direct comparison. Maximum power and
   isometric force were measured at 25 degrees C using peroneus longus (PL)
   and extensor digiti-V (ED-V) muscles from wild rabbits (Oryctolagus
   cuniculus). More than 90\% of the fibres in these muscles are
   fast-twitch, type 2 fibres. Maximum power was measured in force-clamp
   experiments. We show that maximum power per volume was the same in
   intact (121.3 +/- 16.1 W l(-1), mean +/- s.e.m.; N=16) and skinned
   (122.6 +/- 4.6 W l(-1); N=141) fibres. Maximum relative power
   (power/F-IM L-o, where F-IM is maximum isometric force and Lo is
   standard fibre length) was also similar in intact (0.645 +/- 0.037;
   N=16) and skinned (0.589 +/- 0.019; N=141) fibres. Relative power is
   independent of volume and thus not subject to errors in measurement of
   volume. Finally, maximum isometric force per cross-sectional area was
   also found to be the same for intact and skinned fibres (181.9 kPa +/-
   19.1; N=16; 207.8 kPa +/- 4.8; N=141, respectively). These results
   contrast with previous measurements of performance at lower temperatures
   where skinned fibres produce much less power than intact fibres from
   both mammals and non-mammalian species.},

Title = {Hyperactivation of L-type voltage-gated Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> channels in
   <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> striated muscle can result from point

Abstract = {Several human diseases, including hypokalemic periodic paralysis and
   Timothy syndrome, are caused by mutations in voltage-gated calcium
   channels. The effects of these mutations are not always well understood,
   partially because of difficulties in expressing these channels in
   heterologous systems. The use of Caenorhabditis elegans could be an
   alternative approach to determine the effects of mutations on
   voltage-gated calcium channel function because all the main types of
   voltage-gated calcium channels are found in C. elegans, a large panel of
   mutations already exists and efficient genetic tools are available to
   engineer customized mutations in any gene. In this study, we
   characterize the effects of two gain-of-function mutations in egl-19,
   which encodes the L-type calcium channel alpha(1) subunit. One of these
   mutations, ad695, leads to the replacement of a hydrophobic residue in
   the IIIS4 segment. The other mutation, n2368, changes a conserved
   glycine of IS6 segment; this mutation has been identified in patients
   with Timothy syndrome. We show that both egl-19 (gain-of-function)
   mutants have defects in locomotion and morphology that are linked to
   higher muscle tone. Using in situ electrophysiological approaches in
   striated muscle cells, we provide evidence that this high muscle tone is
   due to a shift of the voltage dependency towards negative potentials,
   associated with a decrease of the inactivation rate of the L-type Ca2+
   current. Moreover, we show that the maximal conductance of the Ca2+
   current is decreased in the strongest mutant egl-19(n2368), and that
   this decrease is correlated with a mislocalization of the channel.},

Abstract = {Amphibians have a single ventricle and common conus arteriosus that
   produces an equal pressure to the parallel pulmocutaneous and systemic
   vascular circuits. The distribution of blood flows between the
   pulmocutaneous (Q(pul)) and systemic (Q(sys)) circuits (net cardiac
   shunt) varies with a number of environmental conditions and behaviours;
   although autonomic regulation of pulmonary vascular resistance
   conductance has been emphasized, little attention has been paid to the
   possible contribution of the passive physical characteristics of the two
   circuits to pressure changes associated with variation in cardiac
   output. In this study, we re-analysed three recent studies that recorded
   net cardiac shunts in the cane toad (Rhinella marina) under a variety of
   conditions and treatments. In all three studies, Q(pul) and Q(sys) were
   linearly related to cardiac output (Q(tot)), but the slope was threefold
   higher for Q(pul) compared with Q(sys) as predicted by relative
   conductance increases associated with increases in pressure from
   perfused preparations where autonomic regulation and humoral control
   were eliminated. Our analysis indicates that the net cardiac shunt in
   the cane toad is predicted primarily by the physical, rather than
   physiological, characteristics of the parallel pulmonary and systemic
   vascular circuits.},

Title = {Lactate kinetics of rainbow trout during graded exercise: do catheters
   affect the cost of transport?},

Abstract = {Changes in lactate kinetics as a function of exercise intensity have
   never been measured in an ectotherm. Continuous infusion of a tracer is
   necessary to quantify rates of lactate appearance (R-a) and disposal
   (R-d), but it requires double catheterization, which could interfere
   with swimming. Using rainbow trout, our goals were to: (1) determine the
   potential effects of catheters and blood sampling on metabolic rate ((M)
   over dot(O2)), total cost of transport (TCOT), net cost of transport
   (NCOT) and critical swimming speed (U-crit), and (2) monitor changes in
   lactate fluxes during prolonged, steady-state swimming or graded
   swimming from rest to U-crit. This athletic species maintains high
   baseline lactate fluxes of 24 mu mol kg(-1) min(-1) that are only
   increased at intensities >2.4 body lengths (BL) s(-1) or 85\% U-crit. As
   the fish reaches U-crit, R-a is more strongly stimulated (+67\% to 40.4
   mu mol kg(-1) min(-1)) than R-d (+41\% to 34.7 mu mol kg(-1) min(-1)),
   causing a fourfold increase in blood lactate concentration. Without this
   stimulation of R-d during intense swimming, lactate accumulation would
   double. By contrast, steady-state exercise at 1.7 BL s(-1) increases
   lactate fluxes to similar to 30 mu mol kg(-1) min(-1), with a trivial
   mismatch between R-a and R-d that only affects blood concentration
   minimally. Results also show that the catheterizations and blood
   sampling needed to measure metabolite kinetics in exercising fish have
   no significant impact on (M) over dot(O2) or TCOT. However, these
   experimental procedures affect locomotion energetics by increasing NCOT
   at high speeds and by decreasing U-crit.},

Title = {Stress and death of cnidarian host cells play a role in cnidarian
   bleaching},

Abstract = {Coral bleaching occurs when there is a breakdown of the symbiosis
   between cnidarian hosts and resident Symbiodinium spp. Multiple
   mechanisms for the bleaching process have been identified, including
   apoptosis and autophagy, and most previous work has focused on the
   Symbiodinium cell as the initiator of the bleaching cascade. In this
   work we show that it is possible for host cells to initiate apoptosis
   that can contribute to death of the Symbiodinium cell. First we found
   that colchicine, which results in apoptosis in other animals, causes
   cell death in the model anemone Aiptasia sp. but not in cultured
   Symbiodinium CCMP-830 cells or in cells freshly isolated from host
   Aiptasia ( at least within the time frame of our study). In contrast,
   when symbiotic Aiptasia were incubated in colchicine, cell death in the
   resident Symbiodinium cells was observed, suggesting a host effect on
   symbiont mortality. Using live-cell confocal imaging of macerated
   symbiotic host cell isolates, we identified a pattern where the
   initiation of host cell death was followed by mortality of the resident
   Symbiodinium cells. This same pattern was observed in symbiotic host
   cells that were subjected to temperature stress. This research suggests
   that mortality of symbionts during temperature-induced bleaching can be
   initiated in part by host cell apoptosis.},

Abstract = {Glucocorticoid (GC) hormones have traditionally been interpreted as
   indicators of stress, but the extent to which they provide information
   on physiological state remains debated. GCs are metabolic hormones that
   amongst other functions ensure increasing fuel (i.e. glucose) supply on
   the face of fluctuating energetic demands, a role often overlooked by
   ecological studies investigating the consequences of GC variation.
   Furthermore, because energy budget is limited, in natural contexts where
   multiple stimuli coexist, the organisms' ability to respond
   physiologically may be constrained when multiple triggers of metabolic
   responses overlap in time. Using free-living spotless starling (Sturnus
   unicolor) chicks, we experimentally tested whether two stimuli of
   different nature known to trigger a metabolic or GC response,
   respectively, cause a comparable increase in plasma GCs and glucose. We
   further tested whether response patterns differed when both stimuli
   occurred consecutively. We found that both experimental treatments
   caused increases in GCs and glucose of similar magnitude, suggesting
   that both variables fluctuate along with variation in energy
   expenditure, independently of the trigger. Exposure to the two stimuli
   occurring subsequently did not cause a difference in GC or glucose
   responses compared with exposure to a single stimulus, suggesting a
   limited capacity to respond to an additional stimulus during an ongoing
   acute response. Lastly, we found a positive and significant correlation
   between plasma GCs and glucose after the experimental treatments. Our
   results add to the increasing research on the role of energy expenditure
   on GC variation, by providing experimental evidence on the association
   between plasma GCs and energy metabolism.},

Title = {The role of body size and cuticular hydrocarbons in the desiccation
   resistance of invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile)},

Abstract = {An insect's cuticle is typically covered in a layer of wax prominently
   featuring various hydrocarbons involved in desiccation resistance and
   chemical communication. In Argentine ants (Linepithema humile),
   cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) communicate colony identity, but also
   provide waterproofing necessary to survive dry conditions. Theory
   suggests different CHC compound classes have functional trade-offs, such
   that selection for compounds used in communication would compromise
   waterproofing, and vice versa. We sampled sites of invasive L. humile
   populations from across California to test if CHC differences between
   them can explain differences in their desiccation survival. We
   hypothesized that CHCs whose abundance was correlated with environmental
   factors would determine survival during desiccation, but our regression
   analysis did not support this hypothesis. Interestingly, we found the
   abundance of most CHCs had a negative correlation with survival,
   regardless of compound class. We suggest that the CHC differences
   between L. humile nests in California are insufficient to explain their
   differential survival against desiccation, and that body mass is a
   better predictor of desiccation survival at this scale of comparison.},

   monitoring and detection of preparation for calling},

Abstract = {Vocal emission requires coordination with the respiratory system.
   Monitoring the increase in laryngeal pressure, which is needed for vocal
   production, allows detection of transitions from quiet respiration to
   vocalization-supporting respiration. Characterization of these
   transitions could be used to identify preparation for vocal emission and
   to examine the probability of it manifesting into an actual vocal
   production event. Specifically, overlaying the subject's respiration
   with conspecific calls can highlight events of call initiation and
   suppression, as a means of signalling coordination and avoiding jamming.
   Here, we present a thermal imaging-based methodology for synchronized
   respiration and vocalization monitoring of free-ranging meerkats. The
   sensitivity of this methodology is sufficient for detecting transient
   changes in the subject's respiration associated with the exertion of
   vocal production. The differences in respiration are apparent not only
   during the vocal output, but also prior to it, marking the potential
   time frame of the respiratory preparation for calling. A correlation
   between conspecific calls with elongation of the focal subject's
   respiration cycles could be related to fluctuations in attention levels
   or in the motivation to reply. This framework can be used for examining
   the capability for enhanced respiration control in animals during
   modulated and complex vocal sequences, detecting `failed' vocalization
   attempts and investigating the role of respiration cues in the
   regulation of vocal interactions.},

Title = {Energy expenditure across immune challenge severities in a lizard:
   consequences for innate immunity, locomotor performance and oxidative
   status},

Abstract = {Reptiles, like other vertebrates, rely on immunity to defend themselves
   from infection. The energetic cost of an immune response is liable to
   scale with infection severity, prompting constraints on other
   self-maintenance traits if immune prioritization exceeds energy budget.
   In this study, adult male side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana) were
   injected with saline (control) or high (20 mu g g(-1) body mass) or low
   (10 mu g g(-1) body mass) concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to
   simulate bacterial infections of discrete severities. The costs and
   consequences of the immune response were assessed through comparisons of
   change in resting metabolic rate (RMR), energy metabolites (glucose,
   glycerol, triglycerides), innate immunity (bactericidal ability), sprint
   speed and oxidative status (antioxidant capacity, reactive oxygen
   metabolites). High-LPS lizards had the lowest glucose levels and
   greatest sprint reductions, while their RMR and bactericidal ability
   were similar to those of control lizards. Low-LPS lizards had elevated
   RMR and bactericidal ability, but glucose levels and sprint speed
   changes between those of high-LPS and control lizards. Levels of
   glycerol, triglycerides, reactive oxygen metabolites and antioxidant
   capacity did not differ by treatment. Taken together, energy expenditure
   for the immune response varies in a non-linear fashion with challenge
   severity, posing consequences for performance and self-maintenance
   processes in a reptile.},

Title = {How do red-eyed treefrog embryos sense motion in predator attacks?
   Assessing the role of vestibular mechanoreception},

Abstract = {The widespread ability to alter timing of hatching in response to
   environmental cues can serve as a defense against threats to eggs.
   Arboreal embryos of red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, can hatch
   up to 30\% prematurely to escape predation. This escapehatching response
   is cued by physical disturbance of eggs during attacks, including
   vibrations or motion, and thus depends critically on mechanosensory
   ability. Predator-induced hatching appears later in development than
   flooding-induced, hypoxia-cued hatching; thus, its onset is not
   constrained by the development of hatching ability. It may, instead,
   reflect the development of mechanosensor function. We hypothesize that
   vestibular mechanoreception mediates escapehatching in snake attacks,
   and that the developmental period when hatching-competent embryos fail
   to flee from snakes reflects a sensory constraint. We assessed the
   ontogenetic congruence of escapehatching responses and an indicator of
   vestibular function, the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), in three ways.
   First, we measured VOR in two developmental series of embryos 3-7 days
   old to compare with the published ontogeny of escape success in attacks.
   Second, during the period of greatest variation in VOR and escape
   success, we compared hatching responses and VOR across sibships.
   Finally, in developmental series, we compared the response of individual
   embryos to a simulated attack cue with their VOR. The onset of VOR and
   hatching responses were largely concurrent at all three scales.
   Moreover, latency to hatch in simulated attacks decreased with
   increasing VOR. These results are consistent with a key role of the
   vestibular system in the escape-hatching response of A. callidryas
   embryos to attacks.},

Title = {Co-opting evo-devo concepts for new insights into mechanisms of
   behavioural diversity},

Abstract = {We propose that insights from the field of evolutionary developmental
   biology (or `evo-devo') provide a framework for an integrated
   understanding of the origins of behavioural diversity and its underlying
   mechanisms. Towards that goal, in this Commentary, we frame key
   questions in behavioural evolution in terms of molecular, cellular and
   network-level properties with a focus on the nervous system. In this
   way, we highlight how mechanistic properties central to evo-devo
   analyses - such as weak linkage, versatility, exploratory mechanisms,
   criticality, degeneracy, redundancy and modularity - affect neural
   circuit function and hence the range of behavioural variation that can
   be filtered by selection. We outline why comparative studies of
   molecular and neural systems throughout ontogeny will provide novel
   insights into diversity in neural circuits and behaviour.},

Title = {Evidence for a southward autumn migration of nocturnal noctuid moths in
   central Europe},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {221},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Insect migrations are spectacular natural events and resemble a
   remarkable relocation of biomass between two locations in space. Unlike
   the well-known migrations of daytime flying butterflies, such as the
   painted lady (Vanessa cardui) or the monarch butterfly (Danaus
   plexippus), much less widely known are the migrations of nocturnal
   moths. These migrations - typically involving billions of moths from
   different taxa - have recently attracted considerable scientific
   attention. Nocturnal moth migrations have traditionally been
   investigated by light trapping and by observations in the wild, but in
   recent times a considerable improvement in our understanding of this
   phenomenon has come from studying insect orientation behaviour, using
   vertical looking radar. In order to establish a new model organism to
   study compass mechanisms in migratory moths, we tethered each of two
   species of central European Noctuid moths in a flight simulator to study
   their flight bearings: the red underwing (Catocala nupta) and the large
   yellow underwing (Noctua pronuba). Both species had significantly
   oriented flight bearings under an unobscured view of the clear night sky
   and in the Earth's natural magnetic field. Red underwings oriented south
   southeast, while large yellow underwings oriented southwest, both
   suggesting a southerly autumn migration towards the Mediterranean.
   Interestingly, large yellow underwings became disoriented on humid
   (foggy) nights while red underwings remained oriented. We found no
   evidence in either species for a time-independent sky compass mechanism
   as previously suggested for the large yellow underwing.},

Abstract = {In experiments on active muscle, we examined the tension decline and its
   temperature sensitivity at the onset of ramp shortening and at a range
   of velocities. A segment (similar to 1.5 mm long) of a skinned muscle
   fibre isolated from rabbit psoas muscle was held isometrically
   (sarcomere length similar to 2.5 mu m) at 8-9 degrees C, maximally
   Ca2+-activated and a ramp shortening applied. The tension decline with a
   ramp shortening showed an early decrease of slope (the P-1 transition)
   followed by a slower decrease in slope (the P-2 transition) to the
   steady (isotonic) force. The tension level at the initial P-1 transition
   and the time to that transition decreased as the velocity was increased;
   the length change to this transition increased with shortening velocity
   to a steady value of similar to 8 nm half-sarcomere(-1). A small, rapid,
   temperature jump (T-jump) (3-4 degrees C, <0.2 ms) applied coincident
   with the onset of ramp shortening showed force enhancement by T-jump and
   changed the tension decline markedly. Analyses showed that the rate of
   T-jump-induced force rise increased linearly with increase of shortening
   velocity. These results provide crucial evidence that the
   strain-sensitive cross-bridge force generation, or a step closely
   coupled to it, is endothermic.},

Abstract = {High-speed video analyses of the natural behaviour of parasitoid wasps
   revealed three strategies used to launch the insects into the air. Which
   strategy is the most energy efficient? In Pteromalus puparum, 92\% of
   take-offs by were propelled entirely by movements of the middle and hind
   legs, which were depressed at their coxotrochanteral and extended at
   their femoro-tibial joints. The front legs left the ground first,
   followed by the hind legs, so that the middle legs provided the final
   propulsion. Second, in other species of a similar mass, Cotesia
   glomerata and Leptopilina boulardi, all take-offs were propelled by a
   mean of 2.8 and 3.8 wingbeats, respectively, with little or no
   contribution from the legs. The first strategy resulted in take-off
   times that were four times shorter (5 versus 22.8 ms) and take-off
   velocities that were four times faster (0.8 versus 0.2 m s(-1)).
   Calculations from the kinematics indicate that propulsion by the legs
   was the most energy-efficient strategy, because more energy is put into
   propulsion of the body, whereas in take-off propelled by repetitive wing
   movements energy is lost to generating these movements and moving the
   air. In heavier species such as Netelia testacea and Amblyteles
   armatorius, take-off was propelled by the combined movements of the
   middle and hind legs and wingbeats. In A. armatorius, this resulted in
   the longest mean take-off time of 33.8 ms but an intermediate take-off
   velocity of 0.4 m s(-1). In all three strategies the performance could
   be explained without invoking energy storage and power amplification
   mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Carotenoids are finite resources that animals can allocate to
   self-maintenance, attractiveness or reproduction. Here we test how
   carotenoids affect the acute phase response (APR), an intense rapid
   systemic response characterized by fever, sickness behavior and
   production of acute phase proteins, which serves to reduce pathogen
   persistence. We conducted a 2x2 factorial design experiment in captive
   adult male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to determine
   the effects of carotenoid supplementation on the intensity of the APR.
   We measured changes in feeding rate, activity level and body temperature
   of the birds. We found that, relative to unsupplemented controls,
   carotenoid-supplemented birds exhibited less severe reductions in
   feeding and activity, smaller increases in body temperature and lower
   circulating levels of haptoglobin (an acute phase protein) 24 h after
   inducing an APR. Among supplemented individuals, those with higher blood
   carotenoid levels exhibited a lower reduction in activity rate after 24
   h. Forty-eight hours after APR induction, birds exhibited a significant
   decrease in plasma carotenoid levels and a decrease in bill hue, with
   less reduction in hue in carotenoid-supplemented individuals. These
   results demonstrate that carotenoids can alleviate several important
   behavioral and physiological effects of an APR and that bill color can
   change rapidly following induction of the costly APR immune defense. In
   particular, immune activation may have caused birds to preferentially
   draw down carotenoids from the bloodstream, ostensibly for use in
   health. Rapid bill color changes over a 48-h period support growing
   evidence that bills may serve as short-term signals of health and
   condition.},

Abstract = {The length of time required for postnatal maturation of the locomotor
   muscle (longissimus dorsi) biochemistry {[}myoglobin (Mb) content and
   buffering capacity] in marine mammals typically varies with nursing
   duration, but it can be accelerated by species-specific behavioral
   demands, such as deep-diving and sub-ice transit. We examined how the
   swimming demands of a pelagic lifestyle influence postnatal maturation
   of Mb and buffering capacity in spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris
   longirostris). Mb content of newborn (1.16 +/- 0.07 g Mb per 100 g wet
   muscle mass, n=6) and juvenile (2.77 +/- 0.22 g per 100 g, n=4) spinner
   dolphins were only 19\% and 46\% of adult levels (6.00 +/- 0.74 g per
   100 g, n=6), respectively. At birth, buffering capacity was 52.70 +/-
   4.48 slykes (n=6) and increased to 78.53 +/- 1.91 slykes (n=6) once a
   body length of 141 cm was achieved, representing 1.6- to 2.0-year-old
   dolphins. Based on the age of weaning (1.3-1.6 years postpartum), muscle
   maturation occurred just after weaning as described for coastal
   bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Thus, a pelagic lifestyle does
   not promote rapid maturation of muscle biochemistry. Rather, it promotes
   enhanced muscle biochemistry: newborn and adult spinner dolphins had
   four-and two-times greater Mb contents than newborn and adult bottlenose
   dolphins, respectively. Indeed, adult levels rivaled those of
   deep-diving cetaceans. Nonetheless, the relatively underdeveloped muscle
   biochemistry of calves likely contributes to documented mother-calf
   separations for spinner dolphins chased by the tuna purse-seine fishery.},

Title = {TRPM2 causes sensitization to oxidative stress but attenuates
   high-temperature injury in the sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i>},

Abstract = {In humans, the cation channel TRPM2 (HsTRPM2) has been intensively
   studied because it is involved in oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis
   and also contributes to temperature regulation. The gating mechanism of
   TRPM2 is quite complex, with a C-terminally localized enzyme domain
   playing a crucial role. The analysis of orthologues of TRPM2, in
   particular from the distantly related marine invertebrate Nematostella
   vectensis (NvTRPM2), revealed that during evolution, the functional role
   of the endogenous enzyme domain of TRPM2 has undergone fundamental
   changes. In this study, we investigated whether these evolutionary
   differences also apply to the physiological functions of TRPM2. For this
   purpose, we generated a TRPM2 loss-offunction mutation in N. vectensis
   and compared the phenotypes of wild-type and mutant animals after
   exposure to either oxidative stress or high temperature. Our results
   show that under standard culture conditions, mutant animals are
   indistinguishable from wild-type animals in terms of morphology and
   development. However, exposure of the two experimental groups to
   different stressors revealed that TRPM2 causes sensitization to
   oxidative stress but attenuates high-temperature injury in N. vectensis.
   Therefore, NvTRPM2 plays opposite roles in the cellular response to
   these two different stressors. These findings reveal a similar
   physiological spectrum of activity of TRPM2 in humans and N. vectensis
   and open up the possibility of establishing N. vectensis as a model
   organism for the physiological function of TRPM2.},

Title = {Learning walks in an Australian desert ant, <i>Melophorus bagoti</i>},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {224},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The central Australian ant Melophorus bagoti is the most thermophilic
   ant in Australia and forages solitarily in the summer months during the
   hottest period of the day. For successful navigation, desert ants of
   many species are known to integrate a path and learn landmark cues
   around the nest. Ants perform a series of exploratory walks around the
   nest before their first foraging trip, during which they are presumed to
   learn about their landmark panorama. Here, we studied 15 naive M. bagoti
   ants transitioning from indoor work to foraging outside the nest. In 3-4
   consecutive days, they performed 3-7 exploratory walks before heading
   off to forage. Naive ants increased the area of exploration around the
   nest and the duration of trips over successive learning walks. In their
   first foraging walk, the majority of the ants followed a direction
   explored on their last learning walk. During learning walks, the ants
   stopped and performed stereotypical orientation behaviours called
   pirouettes. They performed complete body rotations with stopping phases
   as well as small circular walks without stops known as voltes. After
   just one learning walk, these desert ants could head in the home
   direction from locations 2 m from the nest, although not from locations
   4 m from the nest. These results suggest gradual learning of the visual
   landmark panorama around the foragers' nest. Our observations show that
   M. bagoti exhibit similar characteristics in their learning walks to
   other desert ants of the genera Ocymyrmex and Cataglyphis.},

Abstract = {The velocity of settling particles is an important determinant of
   distribution in extinct and extant species with passive dispersal
   mechanisms, such as plants, corals and phytoplankton. Here, we adapted
   dynamic scaling, borrowed from engineering, to determine settling
   velocity. Dynamic scaling leverages physical models with relevant
   dimensionless numbers matched to achieve similar dynamics to the
   original object. Previous studies have used flumes, wind tunnels or
   towed models to examine fluid flow around objects with known velocities.
   Our novel application uses free-falling models to determine the unknown
   sinking velocity of planktonic Foraminifera - organisms important to our
   understanding of the Earth's current and historic climate. Using
   enlarged 3D printed models of microscopic Foraminifera tests, sunk in
   viscous mineral oil to match their Reynolds numbers and drag
   coefficients, we predicted sinking velocity of real tests in seawater.
   This method can be applied to study other settling particles such as
   plankton, spores or seeds.},

Title = {Ambient temperature affects multiple drivers of physiology and
   behaviour: adaptation for timely departure of obligate spring migrants},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {We investigated the role of ambient temperature in departure from
   wintering areas of migratory black-headed buntings in spring. Birds
   transferred at 22 and 35 degrees C to long days were compared with one
   another and with controls held on short days for indices of readiness to
   migrate (Zugunruhe, fattening, mass gain), levels of testosterone and
   gonadal recrudescence. Temperature affected the development of migratory
   behaviour and physiology: buntings under long days at 35 degrees C,
   compared with those at 22 degrees C, showed altered migratory behaviour
   (daily activity and Zugunruhe onset), and enhanced muscle growth and
   plasma testosterone levels, but showed no effect on testis growth.
   Temperature was perceived at both peripheral and central levels, and
   affected multiple molecular-drivers culminating into the migratory
   phenotype. This was evidenced by post-mortem comparison of the
   expression of 13 genes with known functions in the skin
   (temperature-sensitive TRP channels: trpv4 and trpm8), hypothalamus
   and/or midbrain (migration-linked genes: th, ddc, adcyap1 and vps13a)
   and flight muscles (muscle growth associated genes: ar, srd5a3, pvalb,
   mtor, myod, mstn and hif1a). In photostimulated birds, the expression of
   trpv4 in skin, th in the hypothalamus and midbrain, and srd5a3, ar,
   pvalb and mtor in flight muscle, in parallel with testosterone levels,
   was greater at 35 degrees C than at 22 degrees C. These results
   demonstrate the role of ambient temperature in development of the spring
   migration phenotype, and suggest that transcriptional responsiveness to
   temperature is a component of the overall adaptive strategy in
   latitudinal songbird migrants for timely departure from wintering areas
   in spring.},

Abstract = {Vitellogenesis ('yolking' of follicles) is a bioenergetically costly
   stage of reproduction requiring enlargement of the liver to produce
   vitellogenin (VTG) yolk precursor proteins, which are transported and
   deposited at the ovary. VTG may, however, serve non-nutritive
   anti-oxidant functions, a hypothesis supported by empirical work on
   aging and other life-history transitions in several taxa. We test this
   hypothesis in female painted dragon lizards (Ctenophorus pictus) by
   examining covariation in VTG with the ovarian cycle, and relative to
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) including baseline superoxide (bSO).
   Plasma VTG decreased prior to ovulation, when VTG is deposited into
   follicles. VTG, however, remained elevated post-ovulation when no longer
   necessary for yolk provisioning and was unrelated to reproductive
   investment. Instead, VTG was strongly and positively predicted by prior
   bSO. ROS, in tum, was negatively predicted by prior VTG, while
   simultaneously sampled VTG was a positive predictor. These findings are
   consistent with the hypothesis that VTG functions as an anti-oxidant to
   counteract oxidative stress associated with vitellogenesis. The
   relationship between bSO and VTG was strongest in post-ovulatory
   females, indicating that its function may be largely anti-oxidant at
   this time. In conclusion, VTG may be under selection to offset oxidative
   costs of reproduction in egg-producing species.},

Title = {Photoperiod modulates the gut microbiome and aggressive behavior in
   Siberian hamsters},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {223},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Seasonally breeding animals undergo shifts in physiology and behavior in
   response to changes in photoperiod (day length). Interestingly, some
   species, such as Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), are more
   aggressive during the short-day photoperiods of the non-breeding season,
   despite gonadal regression. While our previous data suggest that
   Siberian hamsters employ a `seasonal switch' from gonadal to adrenal
   regulation of aggression during shortday photoperiods, there is emerging
   evidence that the gut microbiome, an environment of symbiotic bacteria
   within the gastrointestinal tract, may also change seasonally and
   modulate social behaviors. The goal of this study was to compare
   seasonal shifts in the gut microbiome, circulating levels of adrenal
   dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and aggression in male and female Siberian
   hamsters. Hamsters were housed in either long-day (LD) or short-day (SD)
   photoperiods for 9 weeks. Fecal samples were collected and behaviors
   were recorded following 3, 6 and 9 weeks of housing, and circulating
   DHEA was measured at week 9. SD females that were responsive to changes
   in photoperiod (SD-R), but not SD-R males, displayed increased
   aggression following 9 weeks of treatment. SD-R males and females also
   exhibited distinct changes in the relative abundance of gut bacterial
   phyla and families, yet showed no change in circulating DHEA. The
   relative abundance of some bacterial families (e.g. Anaeroplasmataceae
   in females) was associated with aggression in SD-R but not LD or SD
   non-responder (SD-NR) hamsters after 9 weeks of treatment. Collectively,
   this study provides insight into the complex role of the microbiome in
   regulating social behavior in seasonally breeding species.},

Title = {Selection for reproduction under short photoperiods changes
   diapause-associated traits and induces widespread genomic divergence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY},

Abstract = {The incidence of reproductive diapause is a critical aspect of life
   history in overwintering insects from temperate regions. Much has been
   learned about the timing, physiology and genetics of diapause in a range
   of insects, but how the multiple changes involved in this and other
   photoperiodically regulated traits are inter-related is not well
   understood. We performed quasinatural selection on reproduction under
   short photoperiods in a northern fly species, Drosophila montana, to
   trace the effects of photoperiodic selection on traits regulated by the
   photoperiodic timer and/or by a circadian clock system. Selection
   changed several traits associated with reproductive diapause, including
   the critical day length for diapause (CDL), the frequency of diapausing
   females under photoperiods that deviate from daily 24 h cycles and cold
   tolerance, towards the phenotypes typical of lower latitudes. However,
   selection had no effect on the period of free-running locomotor activity
   rhythm regulated by the circadian clock in fly brain. At a genomic
   level, selection induced extensive divergence from the control line in
   16 gene clusters involved in signal transduction, membrane properties,
   immunologlobulins and development. These changes resembled those
   detected between latitudinally divergent D. montana populations in the
   wild and involved SNP divergence associated with several genes linked
   with diapause induction. Overall, our study shows that photoperiodic
   selection for reproduction under short photoperiods affects
   diapause-associated traits without disrupting the central clock network
   generating circadian rhythms in fly locomotor activity.},

Abstract = {While our knowledge of bivalve gametogenesis has progressed in recent
   times, more molecular markers are needed in order to develop tissue
   imaging. Here, we identified stem cell and mitotic markers to further
   characterize oyster early gametogenesis, mainly through
   immunofluorescence microscopy. Intense alkaline phosphatase activity, a
   non-specific marker for stem cells, was detected on the outer edge of
   the gonad ducts at the post-spawning stage, suggesting an abundance of
   undifferentiated cells very early during the sexual cycle. This
   observation was confirmed using an antibody against Sox2, a
   transcription factor specific for stem or germline cells, which labeled
   cells in the gonad duct inner mass and ciliated epithelium early during
   the initial oyster sexual cycle. Moreover, Vasa, a cytoplasmic marker
   for germline cells, was also detected in the gonad acini and duct cells,
   thus confirming that germline cells were abundant early on. In addition,
   the binding of the minichromosome maintenance MCM6 protein to chromatin
   indicated the gonad acini and duct cells were engaged in the cell cycle.
   DNA replication was indeed confirmed by an abundant in vivo
   incorporation of BrdU into the duct cell chromatin. Finally,
   proliferation of acini and duct cells was demonstrated by the
   chromatin-bound Ser10-phosphorylated histone H3, a mitotic marker. The
   markers for the cell cycle and mitosis used here thus indicate that
   acini and duct cells were already actively dividing early during the
   oyster sexual cycle. In addition, together with the stem cell markers,
   these data reveal that the epithelium delimiting the duct outer edge
   contains a dynamic population of undifferentiated cells.},

Title = {Spiders have rich pigmentary and structural colour palettes},

Abstract = {Elucidating the mechanisms of colour production in organisms is
   important for understanding how selection acts upon a variety of
   behaviours. Spiders provide many spectacular examples of colours used in
   courtship, predation, defence and thermoregulation, but are thought to
   lack many types of pigments common in other animals. Ommochromes, bilins
   and eumelanin have been identified in spiders, but not carotenoids or
   melanosomes. Here, we combined optical microscopy, refractive index
   matching, confocal Raman microspectroscopy and electron microscopy to
   investigate the basis of several types of colourful patches in spiders.
   We obtained four major results. First, we show that spiders use
   carotenoids to produce yellow, suggesting that such colours may be used
   for condition-dependent courtship signalling. Second, we established the
   Raman signature spectrum for ommochromes, facilitating the
   identification of ommochromes in a variety of organisms in the future.
   Third, we describe a potential new pigmentary-structural colour
   interaction that is unusual because of the use of long wavelength
   structural colour in combination with a slightly shorter wavelength
   pigment in the production of red. Finally, we present the first evidence
   for the presence of melanosomes in arthropods, using both scanning and
   transmission electron microscopy, overturning the assumption that
   melanosomes are a synapomorphy of vertebrates. Our research shows that
   spiders have a much richer colour production palette than previously
   thought, and this has implications for colour diversification and
   function in spiders and other arthropods.},

Title = {Controlled feeding trials with ungulates: a new application of <i>in
   vivo</i> dental molding to assess the abrasive factors of microwear},

Abstract = {Microwear, the quantification of microscopic scratches and pits on the
   occlusal surfaces of tooth enamel, is commonly used as a paleodietary
   proxy. For ungulates (hoofed mammals), scratch-dominant microwear
   distinguishes modern grazers from browsers, presumably as a result of
   abrasion from grass phytoliths (biogenic silica). However, it is also
   likely that exogenous grit (i.e. soil, dust) is a contributing factor to
   these scratch-dominant patterns, which may reflect soil ingestion that
   varies with feeding height and/or environmental conditions (e.g. dust
   production in open and/or arid habitats). This study assessed the
   contribution of exogenous grit to tooth wear by measuring the effects of
   fine-and medium-grained silica sand on tooth enamel using a novel
   live-animal tooth-molding technique. It therefore constitutes the first
   controlled feeding experiment using ungulates and the first in vivo
   experiment using abrasives of different sizes. Four sheep were fed three
   diet treatments: (1) a mixture of Garrison and Brome hay (control), (2)
   hay treated with fine-grained silica sand (180-250 mu m) and (3) hay
   treated with medium-grained silica sand (250-425 mu m). We found a
   significant increase in pit features that was correlated with an
   increase in grain size of grit, corroborating earlier chewing simulation
   experiments that produced pits through grit-induced abrasion (i.e. the
   `grit effect'). Our results support an interpretation of large silica
   grains fracturing to create smaller, more abundant angular particles
   capable of abrasion, with jaw movement defining feature shape (i.e.
   scratch or pit).},
