Zhang_et_al_2023,2023,"Highlights • We analyzed the transcriptomic of C.chinensis exposed to temperature stress. • A total of 3,2084 unigenes were obtained after to assemble. • 402 and 111DEGs were induced expression after heat and cold stress respectively. • Twenty-two DEGs of randomly selected were validated by qRT-PCR. Abstract Callosobruchus chinensis is regarded as one of the cosmopolitan pests of legume crops and can cause tremendous losses to a variety of beans. This study focused on comparative transcriptome analyses of C. chinensis exposed to 45 °C (heat stress), 27 °C (ambient temperature) and −3 °C (cold stress) for 3 h to investigate the gene differences and underlying molecular mechanisms. There were 402 and 111 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in the heat and cold stress treatments, respectively. “cell process”, “cell” and “binding” were the main enriched functions and biological processes revealed by gene ontology (GO) analysis. The clusters of orthologous genes (COG) showed that DEGs were assigned to the categories: “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones”, “lipid transport and metabolism”, and “general function prediction only”. With respect to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), the “longevity regulating pathway-multiple species”, “carbon metabolism”, “peroxisome”, “protein processing in endoplasmic”, “glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism” pathways were significantly enriched. The annotation and enrichment analysis revealed that genes encoding heat shock proteins (Hsps) and cuticular proteins were significantly upregulated under high and low-temperature stresses, respectively. In addition, some DEGs encoding “Protein lethal essential for life”, “Reverse transcriptase”, “DnaJ domain”, “Cytochrome” and “Zinc finger protein” were also upregulated to varying degrees. Transcriptomic data were validated using qRT‒PCR, which confirmed that they were consistent. In this paper, the temperature tolerance of C. chinensis adults was evaluated and the results showed that female adults were more sensitive to heat and cold stress than males, and the upregulation of heat shock protein and epidermal protein was the largest in DEGs after heat and cold stress, respectively. These findings provide a reference for further understanding the biological characteristics of C. chinensis adults and the molecular mechanisms underlying the response to low and high temperatures.",10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103479,Journal of Thermal Biology,Insect,Temperature,Adults,Adults,Environmental tolerance and preference,Mortality rate; transcriptome; Differential Gene Expression;  heat shock protein expression; Cuticular proteins;,NA

The thermal tolerance of fish greatly depends on the cardiovascular ability to supply the tissues with oxygen. The highly oxygen-dependent heart mitochondria thus might play a key role in shaping an organism's tolerance to temperature. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of acute and chronic warming on the respiratory capacity of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) heart mitochondria. We hypothesized that acute warming would impair mitochondrial respiratory capacity, but be compensated for by life-time conditioning. Increasing PCO2 may additionally cause shifts in metabolic pathways by inhibiting several enzymes of the cellular energy metabolism. Among other shifts in metabolic pathways, acute warming of heart mitochondria of cold life-conditioned fish increased leak respiration rate, suggesting a lower aerobic capacity to synthesize ATP with acute warming. However, thermal conditioning increased mitochondrial functionality, e.g. higher respiratory control ratios in heart mitochondria of warm life-conditioned compared with cold life-conditioned fish. Exposure to high PCO2 synergistically amplified the effects of acute and long-term warming, but did not result in changes by itself. This high ability to maintain mitochondrial function under ocean acidification can be explained by the fact that seabass are generally able to acclimate to a variety of environmental conditions. Improved mitochondrial energy metabolism after warm conditioning could be due to the origin of this species in the warm waters of the Mediterranean. Our results also indicate that seabass are not yet fully adapted to the colder temperatures in their northern distribution range and might benefit from warmer temperatures in these latitudes.
